if you're launching in a country, you want content that relates closely to those people

actors vs viewership

actors working together =? viewers watching together?

Goal: we want the best country to launch in.

1. low competition
1. future growth to other countries
1. loyal customers / high paying
1. low cost of entry to gain high market share (market share/cost = HIGH)




===================

# Me: Look for trends of things that were MADE in Spain
# Things that Netflix chose from Spain specifically -> trends
Produced in a == Watched in a
Produced in b != Watch in a
