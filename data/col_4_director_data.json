        "biography": "Fuqua began his career directing music videos for popular artists such as Toni Braxton, Coolio, Stevie Wonder, and Prince. From 1998 onwards, he began directing feature films, although he has worked on a few music videos since then. In a tribute article for TIME magazine, Fuqua expressed his early respect for Kurosawa as a filmmaker and how Kurosawa influenced his own perspective on filmmaking stating: \"(screenwriter Hashimoto's) \u2026 working with Akira Kurosawa and Hideo Oguni, was so beautiful and poetic and powerful and heartbreaking. It was all about justice, it was all about sacrifice, and it made me want to be one of those guys\".\n\nHis first feature film was the John Woo-produced action film The Replacement Killers (1998), starring Chow Yun Fat. He then directed the crime thriller Training Day (2001), for which star Denzel Washington won an Academy Award for Best Actor. His next films were the action war drama Tears of the Sun (2003), the Arthurian legend film King Arthur (2004), the conspiracy action thriller Shooter (2007), the crime film Brooklyn's Finest (2009), and the action thrillers Olympus Has Fallen (2013) and The Equalizer (2014), the latter of which again pairs Fuqua with Denzel Washington.\n\nHe co-created the comic-book miniseries After Dark with Wesley Snipes, which was written by Peter Milligan and illustrated by Jeff Nentrup. Fuqua was scheduled to direct Prisoners, based on a storybook from Aaron Guzikowski, but left the project. He was slated to direct Tupac Shakur's official biopic. The project was postponed to allow Fuqua to direct rapper Eminem's second feature film, Southpaw. However, Eminem put Southpaw on hold to focus on music and was replaced with Jake Gyllenhaal. In 2010, CBS Films hired Fuqua to direct a new movie based on a Vince Flynn novel, Consent to Kill. In May 2014, 20th Century Fox set Fuqua to direct a drug-smuggling thriller film Narco Sub, which is scripted by David Guggenheim.",

        "biography": "Steven Allan Spielberg (born December 18, 1946) is an American film director, writer and producer. A major figure of the New Hollywood era and pioneer of the modern blockbuster, he is the most commercially successful director of all time. Spielberg is the recipient of various accolades, including three Academy Awards, a Kennedy Center honor, four Directors Guild of America Awards, two BAFTA Awards, a Cecil B. DeMille Award and an AFI Life Achievement Award. Seven of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\n\nSpielberg was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He moved to California and studied film in college. After directing several episodes for television including Night Gallery and Columbo, he directed the television film Duel (1971) which gained acclaim from critics and audiences. He made his directorial film debut with The Sugarland Express (1974), and became a household name with the 1975 summer blockbuster Jaws. He then directed huge box office successes Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and the Indiana Jones original trilogy (1981-89). Spielberg subsequently explored drama in the acclaimed The Color Purple (1985) and Empire of the Sun (1987).\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, Spielberg directed the science fiction thriller Jurassic Park (1993), the highest-grossing film ever at the time, and the Holocaust drama Schindler's List (1993), which has often been listed as one of the greatest films ever made. He won the Academy Award for Best Director for the latter and for the 1998 World War II epic Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg continued in the 2000s with science fiction films A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), Minority Report (2002) and War of the Worlds (2005). He also directed the adventure films The Adventures of Tintin (2011) and Ready Player One (2018); the historical dramas Amistad (1997), Munich (2005), War Horse (2011), Lincoln (2012), Bridge of Spies (2015) and The Post (2017); the musical West Side Story (2021); and the semi-autobiographical drama The Fabelmans (2022). He has been a producer on several successful films, including Poltergeist (1982), Gremlins (1984), Back to the Future (1985) and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) as well as the miniseries Band of Brothers (2001).\n\nSpielberg co-founded Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks, and has served as a producer for many successful films and television series. He is also known for his long collaboration with the composer John Williams, with whom he has worked for all but five of his feature films. Several of Spielberg's works are among the highest-grossing and greatest films all time. Premiere ranked him first place in the list of 100 Most Powerful People in Movies in 2003. In 2013, Time listed him as one of the 100 most influential people.",

He designed the three mechanical sharks for the movie Jaws (1975) with mechanical effects man Bob Mattey supervising their physical construction in Sun Valley CA.

        "biography": "Spike Lee (born March 20, 1957) is an American filmmaker and actor. He was born Shelton Lee in Atlanta, Georgia. At a very young age, he moved from pre-civil rights Georgia, to Brooklyn, New York. His father was a jazz musician, and his mother, a school teacher. His mother dubbed him Spike, due to his tough nature.\n\nHe attended school in Morehouse College in Atlanta and developed his film making skills at Clark Atlanta University. After graduating, he went to the Tisch School of Arts graduate film program. He made a controversial short, The Answer (1980), a reworking of D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915) -- a ten-minute film. Lee went on to produce a 45-minute film Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads (1983), which won a student academy award. Lee's next film, \"The Messenger,\" in 1984, was somewhat biographical. In 1986, Spike Lee made the film, She's Gotta Have It (1986), a comedy about sexual relationships. The movie was made for 175,000 dollars, and made seven million.  Since then, Lee has become a well-known, intelligent, and talented film maker. His next movie was School Daze (1988), which was set in a historically black school and focused mostly on the conflict between the school and the Fraternities, of which he was a strong critic, portraying them as materialistic, irresponsible, and uncaring.\n\nLee went on to do his landmark film, Do the Right Thing (1989), a movie specifically about his own town in Brooklyn, New York. The movie garnered an Oscar nomination, for Danny Aiello, for supporting actor. It also sparked a debate on racial relations. Lee went on to produce the jazz biopic Mo' Better Blues (1990) which showed his talent for directing and acting, and was the first of many Spike Lee films to feature Denzel Washington.  His next film, Jungle Fever (1991), was about interracial dating. Lee's handling of the subject proved yet again highly controversial. Lee's next film was the self-titled biography of Malcolm X (1992), which had Denzel Washington portraying the civil rights leader. The movie was a success, and resulted in an Oscar nomination for Washington. His next films were the comparatively light, Crooklyn (1994), and the intense crime drama, Clockers (1995). In 1996, Lee directed two movies: the badly received comedy, Girl 6 (1996), and the politically pointed, Get on the Bus (1996), about a group of men going to the Million Man March.  His next film, He Got Game (1998), proved to be another excursion into the collegiate world as he shows the darker side of recruiting college athletes. The movie, in limited release, yet again featured Denzel Washington. In 2000 came Bamboozled which made a mockery out of television and the way African-Americans are perceived by white America and the way African-Americans perceive themselves. The movie, however, was a resounding critical success. Lee also has produced films like New Jersey Drive (1995), Tales from the Hood (1995), and Drop Squad (1994).  He also has produced and or directed movies about Huey P. Newton, Jim Brown, and has commented in many documentaries about varied subjects. Lee is an obsessive New York Knicks fan. He and his wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, have two children.",

        "biography": "Ridley Scott was born on 30th November, 1937, in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, England, the son of Elizabeth and Colonel Francis Percy Scott. He was raised in an Army family, meaning that for most of his early life, his father \u2014 an officer in the Royal Engineers \u2014 was absent. Ridley's older brother, Frank, joined the Merchant Navy when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumbria, Wales and Germany. He has a younger brother, Tony, also a film director. After the Second World War, the Scott family moved back to their native north-east England, eventually settling in Teesside (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner). He enjoyed watching films, and his favourites include Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. Scott studied in Teesside from 1954 to 1958, at Grangefield Grammar School and later in West Hartlepool College of Art, graduating with a Diploma in Design. He progressed to an M.A. in graphic design at the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1962.\n\nAt the RCA he contributed to the college magazine, ARK and helped to establish its film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, Boy and Bicycle, starring his younger brother, Tony Scott, and his father. The film's main visual elements would become features of Scott's later work; it was issued on the 'Extras' section of The Duellists DVD. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series Z-Cars and the science fiction series Out of the Unknown. Scott was an admirer of Stanley Kubrick early in his development as a director. For his entry to the BBC traineeship, Scott remade Paths of Glory as a short film.\n\nHe was assigned to design the second Doctor Who serial, The Daleks, which would have entailed realising the famous alien creatures. However, shortly before Scott was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant that he was replaced on the serial by Raymond Cusick.\n\nAt the BBC, Scott was placed into a director training programme and, before he left the corporation, had directed episodes of Z-Cars, its spin-off, Softly, Softly, and adventure series Adam Adamant Lives!\n\nIn 1968, Ridley and Tony Scott founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.Five members of the Scott family are directors, all working for RSA. Brother Tony has been a successful film director for more than two decades; sons, Jake and Luke are both acclaimed commercials directors as is his daughter, Jordan Scott. Jake and Jordan both work from Los Angeles and Luke is based in London.\n\nIn 1995, Shepperton Studios was purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which extensively renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds. \u00a0",

In addition, Campbell is credited with rejuvenating the James Bond franchise when he directed GoldenEye (1995), Pierce Brosnan's first outing as the famed British spy, which went on to gross more than $350 million.

Campbell made his directorial debut on the British police action series The Professionals (1977) and continued with the popular BBC series Shoestring (1979) and Thames TV's Minder (1979)\n\nConsidered one of the U.K.'s top directors by the mid-'80s, he directed the highly praised British telefilm, Reilly: Ace of Spies (1983). For his work on Edge of Darkness (1985), a five-hour BBC miniseries about nuclear contamination in England that depicted murder and high-ranking corruption, he won six BAFTA awards.\n\nCampbell's first Hollywood movie was Criminal Law (1998) and he went on to direct Defenseless (1991) and No Escape (1994).

        "biography": "Angel Kristi Williams is an award winning filmmaker born and raised in West Baltimore, Maryland. She was 8 years old when her late father gave her a VHS camcorder which sparked her love for the medium. After studying visual art, photography and experimental film, Angel developed a voice that embraces silence and the power of the image to tell a story.  Her feature directorial debut Really Love, produced by MACRO, won the Special Jury Recognition for Acting for co-stars Kofi Siriboe and Yootha Wong-Loi-Sing at SXSW. The film then played as part of AFI Fest\u2019s Special Presentations to much acclaim. Angel is a Sundance Institute Momentum Fellow as well as a Film Independent Project Involve Directing Fellow, where she was the recipient of their Sony Pictures Diversity Fellowship. Angel won an NAACP Image Award for directing Colin in Black and White, her first episode of television. She directed an episode of Naomi for CW and will later helm the season 2 opener of Cherish the Day for OWN.  She splits her time between Baltimore and Los Angeles and holds an MFA in Directing from Columbia College Chicago.\n\nSource: http://www.angelkristiwilliams.com/about/",

        "biography": "Dustin Lee Hoffman (born August 8, 1937) is an American actor and filmmaker. He is known for his versatile portrayals of antiheroes and emotionally vulnerable characters. Actor Robert De Niro described him as \"an actor with the everyman's face who embodied the heartbreakingly human\". At a young age Hoffman knew he wanted to study in the arts, and entered into the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music; later he decided to go into acting, for which he trained at the Pasadena Playhouse in Los Angeles. His first theatrical performance was 1961's A Cook for Mr. General as Ridzinski. During that time he appeared in several guest roles on television shows like Naked City and The Defenders. He then starred in the 1966 off-Broadway play Eh? where his performance garnered him both a Theatre World Award and Drama Desk Award.\n\nHis breakthrough role was as Benjamin Braddock in Mike Nichols' critically acclaimed and iconic film The Graduate (1967), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination. His next role was \"Ratso\" Rizzo in John Schlesinger's Midnight Cowboy (1969), in which he acted alongside Jon Voight; they both received Oscar nominations, and the film went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. He gained success in the 1970s playing roles that shaped the craft of his acting, crossing genres effortlessly in the western Little Big Man (1970), the prison drama Papillon (1973), playing a controversial and groundbreaking comedian in Bob Fosse's Lenny (1975), Marathon Man alongside Laurence Olivier (1976), and as Carl Bernstein investigating the Watergate scandal in All the President's Men (1976). In 1979, Hoffman starred in the family drama Kramer vs. Kramer alongside Meryl Streep. They both received Academy Awards for their performances.\n\nAfter a three-year break from films, Hoffman returned in Sydney Pollack's show business comedy Tootsie (1982) about a struggling actor who pretends to be a woman in order to get an acting role. He returned to stage acting with a 1984 performance as Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman and reprised the role a year later in a television film earning a Primetime Emmy Award. In 1987 he starred alongside Warren Beatty in Elaine May's comedy Ishtar. He won his second Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the autistic savant Ray Babbitt in the 1988 film Rain Man, co-starring Tom Cruise. In 1989, he was nominated for a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award for playing Shylock in a stage performance of The Merchant of Venice. In the 1990s, he made appearances in such films as Warren Beatty's action comedy adaptation Dick Tracy (1990), Steven Spielberg's Hook (1991) as Captain Hook, medical disaster Outbreak (1995), legal crime drama Sleepers (1996), and the satirical black comedy Wag the Dog (1997) alongside Robert De Niro.",

Though Zemeckis has often been pigeonholed as a director interested only in effects, his work has been defended by several critics, including David Thomson, who wrote that \"No other contemporary director has used special effects to more dramatic and narrative purpose.\"",

        "biography": "Paul Thomas Anderson (born June 26, 1970) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. Born in Los Angeles, Anderson developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. An alumnus of the Sundance Institute, Anderson is famous for making often epic psychological drama films which often take place in San Fernando Valley and deal with characters seeking after redemption, forgiveness or loss; they also use wide framing as well as realistic or gritty cinematography. Anderson made his feature film debut with Hard Eight (1996). He found critical and commercial success with Boogie Nights (1997), set in the Golden Age of Porn, and received further accolades with Magnolia (1999), an ensemble piece set in the San Fernando Valley, and Punch-Drunk Love (2002), a romantic comedy-drama film.\n\nAnderson's 2007 film There Will Be Blood, about an oil prospector during the Southern California oil boom, achieved major critical and commercial success and was often cited as one of the greatest films of the 2000s. This was followed by The Master (2012) and Inherent Vice (2014). Anderson's eighth film, Phantom Thread, was released in 2017. He has directed music videos for artists including Fiona Apple, Radiohead, Haim, Joanna Newsom, Aimee Mann, Jon Brion and Michael Penn, and has also directed a documentary, Junun (2015), about the making of the album in India. More recently, he directed a short film accompanying Thom Yorke's Anima (2019), released on Netflix and in select IMAX theatres.\n\nAnderson's films are often characterized by their depiction of flawed and desperate characters, explorations of themes such as dysfunctional families, alienation and loneliness, a bold visual style that uses moving camera and long takes, and memorable use of music. He is noted for his frequent collaborations with actors Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, Melora Walters, John C. Reilly, Joaquin Phoenix and Daniel Day-Lewis, cinematographer Robert Elswit, costume designer Mark Bridges, and composers Jon Brion and Jonny Greenwood. His films have consistently garnered critical acclaim. Anderson has been nominated for eight Academy Awards, one Golden Globe Award and five BAFTA Awards, and has won a Best Director Award at Cannes, both Golden and a Silver Bear at Berlin and a Silver Lion at Venice.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Paul Thomas Anderson, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Clinton \"Clint\" Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American film actor, director, producer, composer and former politician. Following his breakthrough role on the TV series \"Rawhide\" (1959\u201365), Eastwood starred as the Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy of spaghetti westerns (\"A Fistful of Dollars,\" \"For a Few Dollars More,\" and \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\") in the 1960s, and as San Francisco Police Department Inspector Harry Callahan in the Dirty Harry films (\"Dirty Harry,\" \"Magnum Force,\" \"The Enforcer,\" \"Sudden Impact,\" and \"The Dead Pool\") during the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, along with several others in which he plays tough-talking no-nonsense police officers, have made him an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.\n\nEastwood won Academy Awards for Best Director and Producer of the Best Picture, as well as receiving nominations for Best Actor, for his work in the films \"Unforgiven\" (1992) and \"Million Dollar Baby\" (2004). These films in particular, as well as others including \"Play Misty for Me\" (1971), \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" (1976), \"Pale Rider\" (1985), \"In the Line of Fire\" (1993), \"The Bridges of Madison County\" (1995), and \"Gran Torino\" (2008), have all received commercial success and/or critical acclaim. Eastwood's only comedies have been \"Every Which Way but Loose\" (1978) and its sequel \"Any Which Way You Can\" (1980); despite being widely panned by critics they are the two highest-grossing films of his career after adjusting for inflation.\n\nEastwood has directed most of his own star vehicles, but he has also directed films in which he did not appear such as \"Mystic River\" (2003) and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations and \"Changeling\" (2008), which received Golden Globe Award nominations. He has received considerable critical praise in France in particular, including for several of his films which were panned in the United States, and was awarded two of France's highest honors: in 1994 he received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres medal and in 2007 was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur medal. In 2000 he was awarded the Italian Venice Film Festival Golden Lion for lifetime achievement.\n\nSince 1967 Eastwood has run his own production company, Malpaso, which has produced the vast majority of his films. He also served as the nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, from 1986 to 1988. Eastwood has seven children by five women, although he has only married twice. An audiophile, Eastwood is also associated with jazz and has composed and performed pieces in several films along with his eldest son, Kyle Eastwood.\n\nDescription above adapted from the Wikipedia article Clint Eastwood, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His films have earned him a variety of Academy Award, Golden Globe, BAFTA and Palme d'Or Awards and he has been nominated for Emmy and Grammy Awards. In 2007, Total Film named him the 12th-greatest director of all time.\n\nTarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, the son of Connie McHugh Tarantino Zastoupil, a health care executive and nurse born in Knoxville, and Tony Tarantino, an actor and amateur musician born in Queens, New York. Tarantino's mother allowed him to quit school at age 17, to attend an acting class full time. Tarantino gave up acting while attending the acting school, saying that he admired directors more than actors. Tarantino also worked in a video rental store before becoming a filmmaker, paid close attention to the types of films people liked to rent, and has cited that experience as inspiration for his directorial career.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Quentin Tarantino, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

The youngest child and only daughter of filmmakers Eleanor and Francis Ford Coppola, she made her film debut as an infant in her father's acclaimed crime drama film The Godfather (1972). Coppola later appeared in several music videos, as well as a supporting role in Peggy Sue Got Married (1986). Coppola then portrayed Mary Corleone, the daughter of Michael Corleone, in The Godfather Part III (1990). After her performance drew criticism, she turned her attention to filmmaking.\n\nCoppola made her feature-length directorial debut with the coming-of-age drama The Virgin Suicides (1999). It was the first of her collaborations with actress Kirsten Dunst. In 2004, Coppola received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the comedy-drama Lost in Translation and became the third woman to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director. In 2006, Coppola directed the historical drama Marie Antoinette, starring Dunst as the title character. In 2010, with the drama Somewhere, Coppola became the first American woman (and fourth American filmmaker) to win the Golden Lion, the top prize at the Venice Film Festival. In 2013, she directed the satirical crime film The Bling Ring, based on the crime ring of the same name which drew from the Vanity Fair article \"The Suspects Wore Louboutins\" by Nancy Jo Sales about the real group of burglarizing teens who were \"motivated by vanity and worship.\" The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn 2015 she released her Christmas special, A Very Murray Christmas starring Bill Murray on Netflix. At the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, she won Best Director for her work on the drama film The Beguiled, becoming the second woman in the festival's history to win the award. Her latest film, On the Rocks (2020) received a limited theatrical release in October 2020 by A24 as well as a streaming release on AppleTV+. The film received positive reviews, however critics also stated that On the Rocks \"isn't destined to achieve the same kind of iconic status as some of Coppola's previous work\".",

He directed the indie film Safety Not Guaranteed (2012) and the blockbuster film Jurassic World (2015), and also co-wrote the script to Jurassic World and its 2018 sequel.\n\nTrevorrow was born on September 13, 1976 in San Francisco, California. He was raised in Oakland, California. His father was a musician in a country rock band and his mother was a photographer who also operated a day-care center. He is Jewish on his mother's side.\n\nAs a boy, he sang in the chorus of the San Francisco Opera. As a teenager, Trevorrow won awards from the Mill Valley Film Festival and the San Francisco Youth Film Festival. Trevorrow graduated from Piedmont High School in Piedmont, California, and later graduated from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in 1999.\n\nIn 2002, he wrote and directed his first short film, Home Base; as of 2012, it had received over 20 million hits online. Trevorrow's first theatrical release was with Reality Show, a 2004 documentary film about the failed production of a reality television show. Trevorrow sold his first spec script titled Tester to DreamWorks in 2006. In 2008, he paired up with Derek Connolly, ten years after they had first met as NYU students while working as interns on Saturday Night Live, to write a buddy cop film script called Cocked and Loaded. Trevorrow said that the experience was so enjoyable that he decided to give up solo screenwriting and work with Connolly.\n\nIn 2012, Trevorrow directed Safety Not Guaranteed, a film inspired by a classified advertisement which ran in a 1997 issue of Backwoods Home Magazine that read: \"Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 322, Oakview, CA 93022. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.\" The script was by Connolly, who intended for Trevorrow to direct it. The film received various accolades, including a nomination for Trevorrow for the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. The film was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, where it picked up the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award. After the release of Safety Not Guaranteed, Trevorrow and Connolly were hired by the Walt Disney Company to write an as-yet unmade remake of the film Flight of the Navigator (1986). Trevorrow co-wrote and directed Jurassic World (2015), and also provided his voice for the film's character of Mr. DNA. Connolly and Trevorrow also co-wrote the screenplay for its sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, which was released in June 2018 and for which Trevorrow is an executive producer.\n\nAfter Jurassic World, Trevorrow next directed The Book of Henry, which was written by Gregg Hurwitz. The film was released by Focus Features on June 16, 2017 to generally negative reviews, although Trevorrow stood by the film.\n\nOn March 30, 2018 it was announced that Trevorrow would be returning to the Jurassic Park franchise to direct Jurassic World 3 (2021).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Colin Trevorow, licensed under CC-BY-SA, ful list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Bong Joon-ho (Korean: \ubd09\uc900\ud638), born September 14, 1969, is a South Korean film director, producer and screenwriter. His films are characterised by emphasis on social themes, genre-mixing, black humor, and sudden tone shifts.\n\nHe first became known to audiences and achieved a cult following with his directorial debut film, the black comedy Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000), before achieving both critical and commercial success with his subsequent films: the crime thriller Memories of Murder (2003), the monster film The Host (2006), the science fiction action film Snowpiercer (2013), and the Academy Award-winning black comedy social thriller Parasite (2019), all of which are among the highest-grossing films in South Korea, with Parasite also being the highest-grossing South Korean film in history.\n\nAll of Bong's films have been South Korean productions, although both Snowpiercer and Okja (2017) are mostly in the English language. Two of his films have screened in competition at the Cannes Film Festival\u2014Okja in 2017 and Parasite in 2019; the latter earned the Palme d'Or, which was a first for a South Korean film. Parasite also became the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award nominations, with Bong winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay, making Parasite the first film not in English to win Best Picture. In 2017, Bong was included on Metacritic's list of the 25 best film directors of the 21st century. In 2020, Bong was included in Time's annual list of 100 Most Influential Peop;ee and Bloomberg 50.",

Born in Umuahia, Abia State, Nigeria to a large family of seven, Pascal moved to the United States in 1995 after attending Government College Umuahia and the University of Port Harcourt in Rivers State, Nigeria. He initially tried pursuing a career as a civil engineer before switching gears and pursuing a career in the entertainment industry.\n\nIn 2002, he graduated from the Kim Dawson Acting College in Dallas, Texas, and dabbled in theater before relocating to Hollywood. With the help of fellow Nigerian writer/producer/director Michael Ajakwe Jr., Pascal made a successful transition into Los Angeles' highly competitive world of entertainment. Under the tutelage of his mentors -- Michael Ajakwe Jr., and his godfather in the business Ayuko Babu, who is the founder and executive director of the Pan African Film Festival -- Pascal has blossomed into a creative and talented professional.\n\nToday, Pascal is a quintuple threat as a comedian-turned-actor, writer, producer and director added to his credits. As a director, he's helmed most of his seven movie productions - that is, \"The Trace\" (coming soon), \"Who Is the Man?\" \"Okoto the Messenger,\" \"My American Nurse\" and its sequel, \"My American Nurse 2.\" His breakout directorial debut, \"My American Nurse,\" premiered in the United States at the 2006 Pan African Film Festival. Its sequel, My American Nurse 2, also premiered at the Pan African Film Festival. As an actor, he's starred in many of his own productions, as well as other Nollywood projects, including \"Through the Glass,\" \"The Other Side of Love,\" \"Faithfulness\" and \"Secret Past.\"\n\nWith each of his projects, Pascal makes the rounds on the film-festival circuit. Five of his films have been official selections of the Pan African Film Festival and four in Black Harvest International Festival of Film and Video. \"My American Nurse 2,\" was released into the North American market (USA and Canada) in 2010 and quickly became a top selling African movie in the States and Canada. His other films \"Only in America\" and \"Hurricane in the Rose Garden\" were released worldwide by Maverick Entertainment. In 2007, Hurricane in the Rose Garden received an honorable mention in the Pan African Film Festival. Pascal Atuma served as a keynote speaker at UCLA's Fifty Years of African Writing: Novels, Filmmaking, Criticism Seminar on February 14, 2011.",

He directed numerous music videos, most notably Madonna's \"Express Yourself\" in 1989 and \"Vogue\" in 1990, both of which won him the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction. He made his feature film debut with Alien 3 (1992), which garnered mixed reviews, followed by the thriller Seven (1995), which was better received. Fincher found lukewarm success with The Game (1997) and Fight Club (1999), but the latter eventually became a cult classic.

He was educated at The Hotchkiss School and New York University. After starting out as an assistant director on films by Arthur Penn and Otto Preminger, John Avildsen received his first success with the low budget feature Joe (1970) which received critical acclaim for star Peter Boyle and moderate box office business.\n\nThis was followed by another critical success, Save the Tiger (1973), that was nominated for three Oscars, winning Best Actor for star Jack Lemmon.  Avildsen's greatest success was Rocky (1976), garnering ten Academy Award nominations and winning three, including Best Picture and Best Director. He later directed what was expected to be the series' final installment, Rocky V (1990). His other films include Cry Uncle! (1971), Neighbors (1981), The Karate Kid (1984), The Karate Kid Part II (1986), The Karate Kid Part III (1989), Lean on Me (1989) and 8 Seconds (1994).\n\nAvildsen was the original director for both Serpico (1973) and Saturday Night Fever (1977), but was fired over disputes with producers Martin Bregman and Robert Stigwood, respectively.",

        "biography": "Marie Clements (born January 10, 1962) is a Canadian M\u00e9tis playwright, performer, director, producer and screenwriter. She studied journalism at Mount Royal College in Calgary, Alberta. During the 1980s, Clements worked as a radio news reporter. As a writer, she has worked in a variety of mediums including film, television, radio, and live performance. Clements's plays typically consider several overlapping themes, such as racism, sexism, and violence. Her theatrical style is a blending of Aboriginal storytelling, ritual and western theatrical conventions, often reframing authorized Western histories to encourage acknowledgment of alternative narratives.\n\nClements created Urban Ink Production Society in 2001, an Indigenous and multi-cultural theatre company. Before her 2007 departure, she served as artistic director and produced over a dozen new works for the mainstage. Her play Burning Vision toured nationally and was nominated for the 2002 Governor General Award.\n\nIn 2010, Clements founded Working Pajama Lab, which specialized in the story creation and development across film, television, digital media, and live performance. The same year, she was commissioned to create the Aboriginal Pavilion's closing performance at Vancouver's 2010 Winter Olympic Games. This led her to create red diva projects, a production company focused on Indigenous films, live performance, and multi-media works. Their inaugural production, a short film version of the closing performance titled The Road Forward, won Best Music Video at the American Indian Film Festival (AIFF) and the audience award for Best in Show at the Native American Film & Video Festival of the Southeast. Clements' The Edward Curtis Project received a 2013 PuSh Festival award and eight additional nominations, as well as an Ottawa's Circle Award.\n\nClements has found additional success through her self-titled Marie Clements Media production company. The feature-length version of The Road Forward premiered at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, opened the 2017 DOXA Documentary Film Festival and closed the 2018 ImagineNATIVE Film Festival. It received five Leo Awards, an AIFF Best Director Award, and a Writer's Guild nomination for Best Documentary Screenplay.\n\nRed Snow, a war drama film written, directed, and co-produced by Clements, received multiple accolades. It premiered at the 2019 Vancouver International Film Festival and won the Audience Award for Most Popular Canadian Film. Among other acknowledgements, the project garnered 10 Leo Award nominations along with awards at the Edmonton International Film Festival, the L.A. Skins Festival, and AIFF. Clements herself was nominated for a Directors Guild of Canada Best Director Award for her work on the film.\n\nShe has been a playwright in residence at the National Theatre School of Canada, the Banff Centre for the Arts, the Firehall Arts Centre, and the National Arts Centre. Additionally, she has been writer-in-residence at several Canadian universities, including Simon Fraser University and University of British Columbia. The Theatre Research in Canada journal has dedicated a special issue in celebration of Clements's contribution to Canadian theatre. She won the 2018 WFF Women on Top Award and WIFTTV Spotlight Impact Award. In 2019, Clements received the Telefilm Canada Birks Diamond Tribute to Women In Film.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nHelena Bergstr\u00f6m (born 5 February 1964 in Kortedala, Gothenburg) is a Swedish actress.\n\nThe granddaughter of legendary Swedish actor Olof Widgren and the daughter of Hans Bergstr\u00f6m (director) and Kerstin Widgren (actress). Bergstr\u00f6m is married to Colin Nutley and is known for playing the female lead in many of his films. Being one of Sweden\u2019s most highly acclaimed stage actresses she has played the lead part in plays like \u201dMiss Julie\u201d, \u201dTwelfth Night\u201d, \u201dPygmalion\u201d, \u201dPiaf\u201d, \"A Dolls House\", the part of Hamlet in \u201cHamlet\u201d, \u201cMedea\u201d and Blanche in \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire\u201d. In the autumn of 2008 she will play the part of Sally Bowles in Stockholm City Theatre\u2019s production of \u201cCabaret\u201d.\n\nDespite being born into a theatrical family, Bergstr\u00f6m's childhood dream was to work with animals. Aged 15, she travelled to Mississippi in the US as an exchange student and lived there for a year. During this time, she became fascinated with the theatre and decided that the stage was her calling. Back in Sweden, she won a part in a TV series but failed in her first attempt to achieve a place at stage school. Thanks to tuition from Margreth Weivers, she succeeded on her third attempt in 1985.\n\nOn graduating from the Swedish National Academy of Mime and Acting in 1988, she worked at both the Dramaten Theatre and the Stockholm City Theatre. Her breakthrough came with the film 1939 in 1989. Colin Nutley spotted her on a poster for the film \"Women on the roof\" Kvinnorna p\u00e5 taket (1989) and gave her the leading role in his film Blackjack (1990). She was also the obvious choice for his film \u00c4nglag\u00e5rd (1992) as well as its sequel \u201dHouse of Angels \u2013 the Second Summer\u201d. In 1998 she played the part of Astrid in the English production \u201dStill Crazy\u201d which was to be followed by Colin Nutley\u2019s Oscar-nominated \u201dUnder the Sun\u201d - a film that also received the Special Jury Prize at the San Sebastian Film Festival \"for the quality of its acting\".\n\nWinner of several awards including Best Actress at the Swedish Film Awards, the Montreal Film Festival and the 1995 Istanbul Film Festival for her performance in Nutley\u2019s \u201dThe Last Dance\u201d.\n\nIn 2007 she made her directorial debut with \u201cMind the Gap\u201d (Se upp f\u00f6r d\u00e5rarna).\n\nHas two children, a son and a daughter, with Nutley.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Helena Bergstr\u00f6m, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u200b",

His publications include Image and Logic: A Material Culture of Microphysics (1997) and Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps: Empires of Time. His most recent book (2007), co-authored with Lorraine Daston, is titled Objectivity.\n\nIn Image and Logic, Galison explored the fundamental rift rising in the physical sciences: whether singular, visual accounts of scientific phenomenon would be accepted as the dominant language of proof, or whether statistically significant, frequently repeated results would dominate the field. This division, Galison claims, can be seen in the conflicts amongst high-energy physicists investigating new particles, some of whom offer up statistically significant and frequently replicated analysis of the new particle passing through electric fields, others of whom offer up a single picture of a particle behaving\u2014in a single instance\u2014in a way that cannot be explained by the characteristics of existing known particles.\n\nHis work with Lorraine Daston developed the concept of \"mechanical objectivity\" which is often used in scholarly literature, and he has done pioneering work on applying the anthropological notion of \"trading zones\" to scientific practice. He has developed a film for the History Channel on the development of the hydrogen bomb, and has done work on the intersection of science with other disciplines, in particular art (along with his wife, Caroline A. Jones) and architecture. He is on the editorial board of Critical Inquiry and was a MacArthur Fellow in 1996.\n\nGalison has been involved in the production of two documentary films. The first, The Ultimate Weapon: The H-Bomb Dilemma, was about the political and scientific decisions behind the creation of the first hydrogen bomb in the United States, and premiered on the History Channel in 2000. The second, and most recent, Secrecy, Galison directed with Harvard filmmaker Robb Moss, is about the costs and benefits of government secrecy, and premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nBefore moving to Harvard, Galison taught for several years at Stanford University where he was professor of History, Philosophy, and Physics. He is considered part of the \"Stanford School\" of philosophy of science along with Ian Hacking, John Dupr\u00e9, and Nancy Cartwright (philosopher).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Peter Galison,\u00a0licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He is best known for co-writing the screenplay for the movie Evil Dead II with longtime friend, film director Sam Raimi, with whom he attended Wylie E. Groves High School in Birmingham, Michigan. Spiegel played the role of Scotty in Raimi's Within the Woods, which served as a precursor to The Evil Dead.\n\nWhen Spiegel first moved to Los Angeles, he shared a house in with directors Raimi and Joel Coen, producer Ethan Coen and actresses Holly Hunter, Frances McDormand and Kathy Bates. He shared yet another house with roommate and film editor Bob Murawski (Spider-Man). In the early 1990s, he introduced film director Quentin Tarantino to producer Lawrence Bender, who helped Tarantino get Reservoir Dogs made.\n\nSpiegel grew up in what was then \"rural\" Birmingham, Michigan. He attended Walnut Lake Elementary school and then went on to attend West Maple Jr. High School. It was here that Scott met Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Spiegel worked at the local grocery market across from Walnut Lake Elementary School and it is from this market that Scott would later draw upon the memories to come up with classic scenes that would eventually be worked into many of the scenes of the movies he would either write or direct.\n\nIn 1999, Spiegel directed the direct-to-video sequel to From Dusk Till Dawn, Texas Blood Money. Spiegel formed the production company Raw Nerve with film directors Eli Roth, and Boaz Yakin. Raw Nerve produced the film Hostel (2005), directed by Roth.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Scott Spiegel, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

With a career spanning over six decades, she has achieved success in multiple fields of entertainment, and is among the few performers awarded an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony (EGOT).\n\nStreisand began her career by performing in nightclubs and Broadway theaters in the early 1960s. Following her guest appearances on various television shows, she signed to Columbia Records, insisting that she retain full artistic control, and accepting lower pay in exchange, an arrangement that continued throughout her career, and released her debut The Barbra Streisand Album (1963), which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Throughout her recording career, Streisand has topped the US Billboard 200 chart with 11 albums\u2014a record for a woman\u2014including People (1964), The Way We Were (1974), Guilty (1980), and The Broadway Album (1985). She also achieved five number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100\u2014\"The Way We Were\", \"Evergreen\", \"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\", \"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\", and \"Woman in Love\".\n\nFollowing her established recording success in the 1960s, Streisand ventured into film by the end of that decade. She starred in the critically acclaimed Funny Girl (1968), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Additional fame followed with films including the extravagant musical Hello, Dolly! (1969), the screwball comedy What's Up, Doc? (1972), and the romantic drama The Way We Were (1973). Streisand won a second Academy Award for writing the love theme from A Star Is Born (1976), the first woman to be honored as a composer. With the release of Yentl (1983), Streisand became the first woman to write, produce, direct, and star in a major studio film. The film won an Oscar for Best Score and a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Musical. Streisand also received the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, becoming the first (and for 37 years, the only) woman to win that award. Streisand later directed The Prince of Tides (1991) and The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996).\n\nWith sales exceeding 150 million records worldwide, Streisand is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the second highest-certified female artist in the United States, with 68.5 million certified album units. Billboard ranked Streisand as the greatest female artist on the Billboard 200 chart and the top Adult Contemporary female artist of all time. Her accolades include two Academy Awards, 10 Grammy Awards including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and the Grammy Legend Award, five Emmy Awards, four Peabody Awards, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and nine Golden Globes.",

Born on the south side of Chicago, Illinois, Davis has directed several films using Chicago as a backdrop. He is the son of actor Nathan Davis and Metta Davis and the brother of musician Richard \"Richie\" Peter Davis co-founder of the cover band Chicago Catz and Jo Ellen Friedman.\n\nAfter attending Harand Camp of the Theater Arts and Bowen High School, Davis went on to study journalism at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It was not long before his interest in civil rights and anti-war issues converged with his growing interest in film-making. Davis was mentored by acclaimed cinematographer Haskell Wexler with whom he worked on Medium Cool and began his film career as a cameraman on blaxploitation films like The Hit Man, Cool Breeze and The Slams in the 1970s.\n\nHis first feature film as a director was the semi-biographical story, Stony Island. Davis has gone on to direct such films as The Fugitive, Under Siege, Above the Law (both starring Steven Segal), Code of Silence, Holes, The Package and The Guardian.\n\nDavis also directed the cutscenes for the videogame Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory.\n\nIn October 2006, he told a London press conference that he intends to make a film fusing the novels Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes and Tom Jones by Henry Fielding.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Andrew Davis (film director), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He changed his career to film and worked as art director for directors like David Fincher, the Coen brothers, and Terry Gilliam. When Gorak worked as production designer on the 2004 film The Clearing, he expressed afterward to its producers an interest in film direction. They challenged him to provide something viable, and he wrote a script for an intended short film titled Right at Your Door. He eventually directed the 2006 feature thriller film Right at Your Door, which he said was reflective of authorities being impotent in a world after the September 11 attacks. He had initially worried about his film being too similar to 28 Days Later but found inspiration in filming on a low budget. After Right at Your Door, he planned to write and direct a cop drama titled SIS.[4] The film is not yet realized, and Gorak is currently directing the alien invasion film The Darkest Hour for release in 2011.\n\nGorak is a member of the Art Directors Guild.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Chris Gorak, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He would remain in his home country, studying filmmaking at the South African School of Motion Picture Medium and Live Performance, until 1996; that year, he traveled to New York City to visit his cousin who was attending New York University. Soon after the visit, Jonathan enrolled at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nFor his student first film, Jonathan turned Roald Dahl's short story Genesis and Catastrophe (2000) into a 8-minute, award-winning short that help him land Hollywood representation; accolades included the 2000 Hollywood Film Festival's Young Filmmaker Award and the Austin Film Festival's Student Short Film Award.\n\nJonathan would make his feature-film debut in 2002 with Darkness Falls (2003), a dark twist on the Tooth Fairy tale that opened at #1 at the box office despite being critically panned. It also served as the big-screen debut for Emma Caulfield Ford, long a fan-favorite as Anya Jenkins on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997).\n\nRings (2005), his short film that connected The Ring (2002) and its sequel, was first released as a bonus disc with the re-release of The Ring on DVD. The short caught the attention of Michael Bay and his production company, Platinum Dunes, and soon Jonathan was installed as the director of the company's project The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (2006), a prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), the widely successful remake of the original.\n\nInitially announced as the director of the Friday the 13th reboot, Jonathan's next feature would instead be The Killing Room (2009) with Peter Stormare, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Clea DuVall, Timothy Hutton, Nick Cannon and Shea Whigham. The psychological thriller played the festival circuit before being released on DVD in the United States.\n\nA few months before The Killing Room's Sundance world premiere in January 2009, Jonathan was announced as the director of Battle Los Angeles (2011), an alien-invasion film starring Aaron Eckhart and released by Columbia Pictures. The sci-fi/action film was a worldwide hit and put Jonathan in the running for a handful of big-studio pictures.\n\nBefore Battle LA's release, he had handed the job of directing Odysseus as Warner Bros., though that project remains in development at this time. Instead, Jonathan took the reins for Wrath of the Titans (2012), the sequel to successful but maligned Clash of the Titans (2010).",

        "biography": "Ronald William Howard (born March 1, 1954) is an American filmmaker and actor. Howard first came to prominence as a child actor, guest-starring in several television series, including an episode of The Twilight Zone. He gained national attention for playing young Opie Taylor, the son of Sheriff Andy Taylor (played by Andy Griffith) in the sitcom The Andy Griffith Show from 1960 through 1968. During this time, he also appeared in the musical film The Music Man (1962), a critical and commercial success. He was credited as Ronny Howard in his film and television appearances from 1959 to 1973.\n\nHoward was cast in one of the lead roles in the coming-of-age film American Graffiti (1973), which received widespread acclaim and became one of the most profitable films in history. The following year, Howard became a household name for playing Richie Cunningham in the sitcom Happy Days, a role he would play from 1974 through 1984. Howard continued appearing in films during this time, such as the western film The Shootist (1976) and the comedy film Grand Theft Auto (1977), which also marked his directorial debut.\n\nIn 1984, Howard left Happy Days to focus on directing, producing and occasionally writing variety films and television series. His films include the science-fiction/fantasy Cocoon (1985), the fantasy Willow (1988), the thriller Backdraft (1991), the historical docudrama Apollo 13 (1995), the Christmas comedy How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000), the biographical drama A Beautiful Mind (2001), the biographical sports drama Cinderella Man (2005), the thriller The Da Vinci Code (2006), the historical drama Frost/Nixon (2008), Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), and the documentary Pavarotti (2019). For A Beautiful Mind, Howard won the Academy Award for Best Director and Academy Award for Best Picture. He was nominated again for the same awards for Frost/Nixon.\n\nIn 2003, Howard was awarded the National Medal of Arts. He was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 2013.

        "biography": "Roman Pola\u0144ski (born 18 August 1933) is a Polish-French film director, producer, writer and actor. Born in Paris to Polish parents, Pola\u0144ski relocated with his family to Poland in 1937. After surviving the Holocaust, he continued his education in Poland and became a critically acclaimed director of both art house and commercial films. Pola\u0144ski's first feature-length film, Knife in the Water (1962), made in Poland, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. He has since received five more Oscar nominations, and in 2002 received the Academy Award for Best Director for his film, The Pianist. He has also been the recipient of two Baftas, four C\u00e9sars, a Golden Globe and the Palme d'Or. He left Poland in 1961 to live in France for several years, then moved to the United Kingdom where he collaborated with G\u00e9rard Brach on three films, beginning with Repulsion (1965). In 1968 he moved to the United States, immediately cementing his burgeoning directing status with the 1968 groundbreaking Academy Award winning horror film Rosemary's Baby.\n\nIn 1969, Pola\u0144ski's pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered while staying at the Pola\u0144ski's Benedict Canyon home above Los Angeles by members of the Manson Family. Following Tate's death, Pola\u0144ski returned to Europe and spent much of his time in Paris and Gstaad, but did not make another film until he filmed Macbeth (1971) in England. The following year he went to Italy to make What? (1973) and subsequently spent the next five years living near Rome. However, he traveled to Hollywood to direct Chinatown (1974) for Paramount Pictures, with Robert Evans serving as producer. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, and was a critical and box-office success; the script by Robert Towne won for Best Original Screenplay. Pola\u0144ski's next film, The Tenant (1976), was shot in France, and completed the \"Apartment Trilogy\", following Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.\n\nIn 1977, after a photo shoot in Los Angeles, Pola\u0144ski was arrested for the sexual abuse of a 13 year old girl. He was charged with rape but pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor. To avoid sentencing, Pola\u0144ski fled to his home in London, and then moved on to France the following day. He has had a U.S. arrest warrant outstanding since then, and an international arrest warrant since 2005.\n\nPola\u0144ski continued to make films such as The Pianist (2002), a World War II-set adaptation of Jewish-Polish musician W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman's autobiography of the same name, which echoed some of Pola\u0144ski's earlier life experiences. Like Szpilman, Pola\u0144ski escaped the ghetto and the concentration camps while family members were killed. The film won three Academy Awards including Best Director, the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or, and seven French C\u00e9sar Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. He then released the successful films Oliver Twist (2005), To Each His Own Cinema (2007), and The Ghost Writer (2010), completed while under house arrest.\n\nIn September 2009, Pola\u0144ski was arrested by Swiss police, at the request of U.S. authorities, when he traveled to receive a lifetime achievement award at the Zurich Film Festival. In October 2009, the U.S. requested his extradition; however, on July 12, 2010, the Swiss rejected that request and instead declared him a \"free man\" after releasing him from custody.",

He has primarily worked in the horror genre as the co-creator of the \"Saw\" and \"Insidious\" franchises and the creator of \"The Conjuring\" universe. Wan is also the founder of Atomic Monster Productions, which has produced film and television projects.\n\nAfter directing the micro-budget film \"Stygian\" (2000), Wan made his professional feature directorial debut with \"Saw\" (2004). The film was a hit and launched a franchise that has grossed more than $1 billion globally. Following a period of setbacks with the underperforming titles \"Dead Silence\" and \"Death Sentence\" (both 2007), Wan returned to commercial success with the PG-13 supernatural horror-fantasy \"Insidious\" (2010), and went on to direct \"Insidious: Part 2\" (2013) and to produce further sequels in the series. In between his two \"Insidious\" projects, Wan directed the more traditional supernatural horror film \"The Conjuring\" (2013), which achieved enormous critical and commercial success and spawned a sprawling set of sequels and spin-offs collectively known as The Conjuring Universe. Wan served as the director of \"The Conjuring 2\" (2016) while producing subsequent films in the franchise such as \"Annabelle\" (2014) and \"The Nun\" (2018). The Conjuring Universe is the second highest-grossing horror franchise at over $2 billion.\n\nOutside of horror, Wan directed \"Furious 7\" (2015), the seventh installment in the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise, and the DC Extended Universe superhero film \"Aquaman\" (2018). Both grossed over $1 billion, making Wan the eighth director with two films to reach the milestone. He is the 20th highest-grossing director of all time as of 2021, with his films having grossed over $3.6 billion worldwide.",

Stone became known in the late 1980s and the early 1990s for directing a series of films about the Vietnam War, in which he had participated as an American infantry soldier. His work frequently focuses on contemporary political and cultural issues, often controversially. He has received three Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay for Midnight Express (1978), and Best Director for Platoon (1986) and Born on the Fourth of July (1989). The British newspaper The Guardian described him as \"one of the few committed men of the left working in mainstream American cinema.\"\n\nStone's movies often use many different cameras and film formats, including VHS, 8 mm film, and 70 mm film. He sometimes uses several formats in a single scene, as in Natural Born Killers (1994) and JFK (1991).",

For her work on \"Selma\" (2014), DuVernay was the first black female director to be nominated for a Golden Globe Award and also the first to have her film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, though she was not nominated for Best Director.

Chicago Tribune film critic Roger Ebert, in his review of the movie, called it \"an extraordinary documentary about what happened next, as a town banded together to stop what folks saw as a miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nHe graduated from Colgate University in 1983.

        "biography": "Haggis began to work as a writer for television programs, including The Love Boat, One Day at a Time, Diff'rent Strokes, and The Facts of Life. With The Facts of Life, Haggis also gained his first credit as producer. During the 1980s and 1990s, Haggis wrote for television series including thirtysomething, The Tracey Ullman Show, FM, Due South, L.A. Law, and EZ Streets. He helped to create the television series Walker, Texas Ranger; Family Law; and Due South. Haggis served as executive producer of the series Michael Hayes and Family Law.\n\nHe gained recognition in the film industry for his work on the 2004 film Million Dollar Baby, which Allmovie described as a \"serious milestone\" for the writer/producer, and as \"his first high-profile foray into feature film\". Haggis had read two stories written by Jerry Boyd, a boxing trainer who wrote under the name of F.X. Toole.\n\nHaggis later acquired the rights to the stories, and developed them into the screenplay for Million Dollar Baby. Clint Eastwood portrayed the lead character in the film. Eastwood also directed the film, and used the screenplay written by Haggis. Million Dollar Baby received four Academy Awards including the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nAfter Million Dollar Baby, Haggis worked on the 2004 film Crash. Haggis came up with the story for the film on his own, and then wrote and directed the film, which allowed him greater control over his work. Crash was his first experience as director of a major feature film. Highly positive upon release, critical reception of Crash has since polarized, although Roger Ebert called it the best film of 2005.\n\nCrash received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Director, in addition to four other Academy Award nominations. Haggis received two Academy Awards for the film: Best Picture (as its producer), and Best Writing for his work on the screenplay. With Million Dollar Baby and then Crash, Haggis became the first individual to have written Best Picture Oscar-winners in two consecutive years.\n\nHaggis said that he wrote Crash to \"bust liberals\", arguing that his fellow liberals were not honest with themselves about the nature of race and racism because they believed that most racial problems had already been resolved in American society.",

        "biography": "Martin Charles Scorsese (born November 17, 1942) is an American film director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. One of the major figures of the New Hollywood era, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential directors in film history. Scorsese's body of work explores themes such as Italian-American identity, Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption, faith, machismo, nihilism, crime and sectarianism. Many of his films are known for their depiction of violence and the liberal use of profanity. Scorsese has also dedicated his life to film preservation and film restoration by founding the nonprofit organization The Film Foundation in 1990, as well as the World Cinema Foundation in 2007 and the African Film Heritage Project in 2017.\n\nScorsese studied at New York University (NYU), where he received a bachelor's degree in English literature in 1964, and received a master's degree in fine arts in film from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts in 1968. In 1967 Scorsese's first feature film Who's That Knocking at My Door was released and was accepted into the Chicago Film Festival, where critic Roger Ebert saw it and called it \"a marvelous evocation of American city life, announcing the arrival of an important new director\".\n\nHe has established a filmmaking history involving repeat collaborations with actors and film technicians, including nine films made with Robert De Niro. His films with De Niro are the psychological thriller Taxi Driver (1976), the biographical sports drama Raging Bull (1980), the satirical black comedy The King of Comedy (1982), the musical drama New York, New York (1977), the psychological thriller Cape Fear (1991), and the crime films Mean Streets (1973), Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995) and The Irishman (2019). Scorsese has also been noted for his collaborations with actor Leonardo DiCaprio, having directed him in five films: the historical epic Gangs of New York (2002), the Howard Hughes biography The Aviator (2004), the crime thriller The Departed (2006), the psychological thriller Shutter Island (2010), and the Wall Street black comedy The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). The Departed won Scorsese an Academy Award for Best Director, and for Best Picture. Scorsese is also known for his long-time collaboration with film editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who has edited every Scorsese film beginning with Raging Bull. Scorsese's other film work includes the black comedy After Hours (1985), the romantic drama The Age of Innocence (1993), the children's adventure drama Hugo (2011), and the religious epics The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Kundun (1997) and Silence (2016).",

His paternal grandparents were Polish. In 1967, the family moved to California, and young Gregor grew up near San Diego. His biggest influences as a kid were Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis and Black Sabbath's Master of Reality. He started his professional career as a guitarist for punk-rock bands, such as The Daredevils and The Little Kings, and also made his first films together with friends. After having developed a passion for filmmaking, he sold his guitar to buy a Super-8mm camera. Then Verbinski attended the prestigious UCLA Film School, from which he graduated in 1987 with his BFA in Film. His first professional directing jobs were music videos for alternative bands, such as L7, Bad Religion, and Monster Magnet. Then he moved to advertising and directed commercials for Nike, Canon, Skittles, United airlines and Coca-Cola. In 1993 he created the renowned Budweiser advertising campaign featuring croaking frogs, for which he was awarded the advertising Silver Lion at Cannes and also received four Clio Awards.\n\nVerbinski made his feature directorial debut with Mousehunt (1997), a remarkably visual cartoonish family comedy. His next effort, The Mexican (2001), came to a modest result. However, Verbinski bounced back with a hit thriller The Ring (2002), grossing over $230 million dollars worldwide. His biggest directorial success came with the Disney theme park ride based Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), with a brilliant acting ensemble, grossing over $650 million dollars, and bringing five Oscar nominations and many other awards and nominations. Disney ordered two more films which Verbinski shot one after another on location in the Carribean islands, for which he had to endure both tetanus and typhoid immunization shots. After having survived several hurricanes, dealing with sick and injured actors, and troubleshooting after numerous technical difficulties of the epic-scale project, Verbinski delivered. He employed the same stellar cast in the sequel Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) and the third installment of the 'Pirates' franchise Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007).\n\nGore Verbinski does not like publicity. He has been enjoying a happy family life with his wife and his two sons. He resides with his family in Los Angeles, California.",

Following his film debut in the drama Taps (1981), and a diverse range of film roles in the 1980s, including Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and Bad Boys (1983), Penn garnered critical attention for his roles in the crime dramas At Close Range (1986), State of Grace (1990), and Carlito's Way (1993). He became known as a prominent leading actor with the drama Dead Man Walking (1995), for which he earned his first Academy Award nomination and the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the Berlin Film Festival. Penn received another two Oscar nominations for Woody Allen's comedy-drama Sweet and Lowdown (1999) and the drama I Am Sam (2001), before winning his first Academy Award for Best Actor in 2003 for Mystic River and a second one in 2008 for Milk. He has also won a Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival for the Nick Cassavetes-directed She's So Lovely (1997), and two Volpi Cups for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for the indie film Hurlyburly (1998) and the drama 21 Grams (2003).\n\nPenn made his feature film directorial debut with The Indian Runner (1991), followed by the drama film The Crossing Guard (1995) and the mystery film The Pledge (2001); all three were critically well received. Penn directed one of the 11 segments of 11'09\"01 September 11 (2002), a compilation film made in response to the September 11 attacks. His fourth feature film, the biographical drama survival movie Into the Wild (2007), garnered critical acclaim and two Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn addition to his film work, Penn has engaged in political and social activism, including his criticism of the George W. Bush administration, his contact with the Presidents of Cuba and Venezuela, and his humanitarian work in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the 2010 Haiti earthquake.",

        "biography": "Muhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.; January 17, 1942 \u2013 June 3, 2016) was an American professional boxer, activist, entertainer and philanthropist. Nicknamed The Greatest, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated figures of the 20th century and as one of the greatest boxers of all time.\n\nAli was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. He began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics and turned professional later that year. He became a Muslim after 1961. He won the world heavyweight championship from Sonny Liston in a major upset on February 25, 1964, at age 22. On March 6, 1964, he announced that he no longer would be known as Cassius Clay but as Muhammad Ali. In 1966, Ali refused to be drafted into the military, citing his religious beliefs and ethical opposition to the Vietnam War. He was found guilty of draft evasion so he faced 5 years in prison and was stripped of his boxing titles. He stayed out of prison as he appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which overturned his conviction in 1971, but he had not fought for nearly four years and lost a period of peak performance as an athlete. Ali's actions as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War made him an icon for the larger counterculture generation, and he was a very high-profile figure of racial pride for African Americans during the civil rights movement and throughout his career. As a Muslim, Ali was initially affiliated with Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam (NOI). He later disavowed the NOI, adhering to Sunni Islam, and supporting racial integration like his former mentor Malcolm X.\n\nAli was a leading heavyweight boxer of the 20th century, and he remains the only three-time lineal champion of that division. His joint records of beating 21 boxers for the world heavyweight title and winning 14 unified title bouts stood for 35 years. He is the only fighter to have been ranked as the world's best heavyweight by BoxRec twelve times. He has been ranked among BoxRec's ten best heavyweights seventeen times, the third most in history. He won 8 fights that were rated by BoxRec as 5-Star, the third most in the history of the heavyweight division. Ali is the only boxer to be named The Ring magazine Fighter of the Year six times. He has been ranked the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time, and as the greatest athlete of the 20th century by Sports Illustrated, the Sports Personality of the Century by the BBC, and the third greatest athlete of the 20th century by ESPN SportsCentury. He was involved in several historic boxing matches and feuds, most notably his fights with Joe Frazier, such as the Fight of the Century and the Thrilla in Manila, and his fight with George Foreman, known as The Rumble in the Jungle, which has been called \"arguably the greatest sporting event of the 20th century\" and was watched by a record estimated television audience of 1 billion viewers worldwide, becoming the world's most-watched live television broadcast at the time. Ali thrived in the spotlight at a time when many fighters let their managers do the talking, and he was often provocative and outlandish. He was known for trash-talking, and often free-styled with rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry, anticipating elements of hip hop.",

He is the older brother of actor Yaniss Lespert.\n\nPushed by his mother, a lawyer, Jalil Lespert began studying law, but he changed his mind when in 1995, Laurent Cantet noticed him and cast him with his father in the short film Jeux de Plage. Subsequently, the young actor reunited with the director to shoot the TV film Les Sanguinaires in 1997. Two years later, Laurent Cantet offered him a new role, this time in the cinema, in the film Ressources Humaines. Thanks to the role of Franck, he was revealed to the general public and won the C\u00e9sar for best male actor in 2001. In 2003, he won the prize for best new actor at the Cabourg Film Festival for his role in Vivre me tue by Jean- Pierre Sinapi. From then on, the actor made a series of films (Pas sur la bouche, Le Promeneur du Champ-de-Mars, Virgil, Le petit Lieutenant\u2026).\n\nJalil Lespert also stands out as a director. In 2007, he moved behind the camera and signed the feature film 24 measures. A few years later, he repeated the experience with the adaptation of the novel Contrary Winds, which received a good reception. In 2014, he co-wrote and directed the biopic dedicated to Yves Saint-Laurent, played by Pierre Niney. In 2015, he joined the team of directors of the series Versailles, broadcast on Canal+, which was a great success. He continued the following year with the production of the feature film Iris in which he also starred. Since then, Jalil Lespert has alternated between his career as a director and that of an actor. In 2020, he starred in La terre des hommes by No\u00ebl Marandin and L\u2019Enfant r\u00eave by Rapha\u00ebl Jacoulot.\n\nOn the private side, Jalil Lespert has shared the life of Sonia Rolland since 2009. The couple has a daughter, Kahina, born in November 2010. From his union with the actress B\u00e9rang\u00e8re Allaux, the actor has two children, a boy named Aliosha and a daughter, Gena. In October 2018, he announced on social networks that he was separated from Sonia Rolland. On December 15, 2020, he formalized his relationship with the widow of Johnny Hallyday, Laeticia, on Instagram.

Graduating with a B.A. in English from Arizona State University, Brian fulfilled his passion for storytelling by co-writing and directing, Blood Moon Rising (2010). Distributed by Entertainment One, the horror comedy found great success in the Zombie genre, so much so, that Brian was asked to direct the thriller, Dirty Little Trick (2011), starring Dean Cain and Michael Madsen, and that film premiered as a Showtime Original.\n\nSince 2012, Brian has produced, directed and/or written twenty-two feature films, all of them premiering on Prime Time TV or in the theaters. In 2017, Brian directed the fast-paced female empowerment fight movie, Chokehold. That same year he directed a Grindhouse Horror Comedy Rottentail, based on a graphic novel by the same name, and published by Source Point Press. The film was released into select theaters and garnered sold-out crowds. It was also accepted into a slew of international film festivals.\n\nMost recently Brian directed, My Adventures with Santa starring Barbara Eden, Denise Richards and Patrick Muldoon for Universal Studios and has a theatrical release Christmas 2019. Universal Studios was so happy with the film they've asked him to write and direct Christmas Castle (2020). Brian's favorite quote from the highly regarded Director, Alfred Hitchcock is, \"To make a great film you need three things - the script, the script and the script.\"",

After writing screenplays for several teen comedies in the mid-1980s, he made his directorial debut with a teen adventure, Adventures in Babysitting (1987). Columbus gained recognition soon after with the highly successful Christmas comedy Home Alone (1990) and its sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992).\n\nThe comedy Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), starring Robin Williams, was another box office success for Columbus. He went on to direct several other films throughout the 1990s, which were mostly met with lukewarm reception. However, he found commercial success again for directing the film adaptations of J. K. Rowling's novels, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) and its sequel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), which are his highest-grossing films to date. In addition to directing, Columbus was a producer for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), and the drama The Help (2011). He also directed the fantasy Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief (2010) and the 3D action comedy Pixels (2015).\n\nColumbus is the co-founder of 1492 Pictures, a film production company that has produced some of his films since 1995. More recently, he co-founded another production firm with his daughter in 2014, called Maiden Voyage Pictures. In 2017, he launched ZAG Animation Studios, alongside Michael Barnathan, Haim Saban, and Jeremy Zag.",

Though Chahal received numerous international awards, including the prestigious Silver Lion at the 2003 Venice International Film Festival, her body of work remains relatively unknown.\n\nMost subjects in Chahal's nine narrative films and documentaries dealt with encounters between the absurdity of war stories and the gentle bitterness of solitary, thoughtful characters. Known for their satirical tone and trenchant dialogue, her films have long been considered provocative. Around 40 minutes of her 1999 film Civilis\u00e9es (A Civilized People), a black comedy about the Lebanese Civil War, were censored and thus the film was only screened once.\n\nFilm critics began to recognize Chahal's work in 2003, when her feature The Kite won the Silver Lion award and several other prestigious prizes. That year, she received the National Order of the Cedar decoration in the grade of Officer from the country of Lebanon. Chahal died at age 54 in Paris, France, leaving one announced film unreleased.",

Winner of the Laurel Award (2004 and 2007), the White Elephant Award (2007), the Silver Bear Prize for Outstanding Artistic Achievements at the Berlin International Film Festival (2010), the Golden Eagle Award (2011).\n\nIn 1991, Pavel graduated from the biology class at school No. 523 in Moscow. After graduating from school, he first studied to be an ichthyologist, but his love for photography led him to the VGIK camera department, which he graduated from in 2002. While still a student , he began working with director Sergei Loznitsa on documentaries: \"Way Station\" (2000), \"Settlement\" (2001), \"Portrait\" (2002). Soon, at one of the European film festivals, I met Antoine Cattin, a Swiss cinematographer, director and future co-author. In 2003, on the set of \"Landscape\" with Loznitsa, a case brought a talkative trucker Valera to the same hotel in Okulovka. It was Kattin who insisted on making a Transformer movie out of it later. The union continued with the documentaries \"Peaceful Life\" (2004), \"Mother\" (2007), which received many festival awards (in Anapa, Yekaterinburg, Moscow; in Argentina, Poland, Finland) and awards \u2014 \"Laurel\", \"White Elephant\". For ten years, Antoine Kattin and Pavel Kostomarov filmed director Alexei German during his work on the \"History of the Arkanar Massacre\", which resulted in the film \"Playback\" in 2012. In collaboration with documentary filmmaker Alexander Rastorguev in Rostov-on-Don, he made documentaries \"I love you\" (2010) and \"I don't love you\" (2012). Together with NTV presenter Alexey Pivovarov and documentarian Alexander Rastorguev, he created the Internet project \"Term\" in 2012. In December 2012, together with NTV host Alexey Pivovarov and Alexander Rastorguev, he launched a large-scale documentary project \"Reality\"[10]. Together with them and other co-authors: Antoine Kattin, Susanna Barangieva and Dmitry Kubasov, Pavel Kostomarov conducted casting and looked for potential heroes of the project.\n\nIn addition to documentaries, Pavel continued to make feature films with Alexey Popogrebsky (\"Simple Things\", \"How I spent this summer\"), with Boris Khlebnikov (the short story \"The Saving Tunnel\" from the movie almanac \"There is no hurry\", \"Until the Night Separates\", \"A Long Happy Life\").\n\nShortly after February 24, 2022, he left Russia. He lives in Argentina.",

At Oxford University, Hooper directed plays and television commercials. After graduating, he directed episodes of Quayside, Byker Grove, EastEnders, and Cold Feet on British television. In the 2000s, Hooper directed the major BBC costume dramas Love in a Cold Climate (2001) and Daniel Deronda (2002), as well as the 2003 revival of ITV's Prime Suspect series, starring Helen Mirren. Hooper made his feature film debut with Red Dust (2004), a British drama starring Hilary Swank and Chiwetel Ejiofor, before directing Helen Mirren again in the Company Pictures/HBO Films historical drama Elizabeth I (2005). He continued working for HBO on the television film Longford (2006) and in John Adams (2008), a seven-part serial on the life of the American president. Hooper returned to features with The Damned United (2009), a fact-based film about the English football manager Brian Clough (played by Michael Sheen). The following year saw the release of the historical drama The King's Speech (2010), starring Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, which was met with critical acclaim. Hooper's next film was Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012), which featured an all-star cast led by Hugh Jackman. His 2015 film, The Danish Girl, was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best British Film. Recently, Hooper has directed two episodes of His Dark Materials and a live-action adaptation of the musical Cats, for which he won two Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Director and Worst Screenplay.\n\nHooper's work was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for Prime Suspect and John Adams, won one for Elizabeth I, and was nominated for the British Academy (BAFTA) TV Craft Award for Best Director for Longford. The King's Speech won multiple awards, including Best Director wins for Hooper from the Directors Guild of America and the Academy Awards and a Best Director nomination from BAFTA.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Tom Hooper (director), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u00a0",

Also in 2005, he plays a gay coffee barista named Andy in 29th and Gay.\n\nOn June 2, 2009, The New York Times published an article about Doyle and his tendency to die on screen during his acting roles. His seventh death, in the season 10 finale of Law and Order Special Victims Unit, ended a successful six year run as forensic tech Ryan O\u2019Halloran on the show.\n\nHe recently guest starred in the Criminal Minds episode, \"A Rite of Passage\", as well as the In Plain Sight episode, \"Coma Chameleon\". He also appeared alongside Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart in Rabbit Hole.",

His debut film C/o Kancharapalem (2018) was shot in the village of the same name. The cast of the film comprised entirely newcomers. Regarding his work in the film one critic noted that \"Full marks to Venkatesh for not only coming up with a different kind of film but successfully carrying off the experiment of roping in locals for a film which is about themselves\" whilst another stated that \"If the director Venkatesh Maha is the brain behind this idea, he deserves credit yes\". His next film was Uma Maheswara Ugra Roopasya, the remake of the Malayalam film Maheshinte Prathikaaram. The film featured Satyadev Kancharana in the lead role and was shot extensively in the Araku valley. Regarding his casting in the film, a critic wrote that \"And a big shout to Venkatesh Maha\u2019s casting choices, which makes the movie more relatable\".",

        "biography": "While studying at the Department of Tourism and Hotel Management of Bogazici University, he started drawing comics for the Turkish humor magazine Leman. In August 1995 he did his first stand-up comedy show in \"Leman Culture Center\" performing with no serious career intentions as a comedian. However, after the positive response of the audience, he continued his show to attract larger crowds in Besiktas Cultural Center where he has appeared in over a thousand stand-up comedy shows since, becoming so popular that tickets have sold for 250TL (approx. US$140).\n\nHis movie career started in 1998 with a co-starring role in the comedy Everything's Gonna Be Great (1998), directed by \u00d6mer Vargi, and continued with a role in Vizontele (2001), directed by Yilmaz Erdogan and \u00d6mer Faruk Sorak. He achieved his greatest success by starring in and writing big-budget science-fiction parody G.O.R.A. (2004), also directed by \u00d6mer Faruk Sorak, which despite spending several years in production because of financial and other technical problems became a box-office hit and described by Rekin Teksoy as a strong sign that showed that popular cinema was successful in appealing to wide audiences. He maintained this success with a starring role in the comedy feature movie Magic Carpet Ride (2005) AKA 'Magic Carpet Ride', also directed by Yilmaz Erdogan, for which he won Best Supporting Actor at the 11th Sadri Alisik Awards, and his directorial debut with The Magician (2006), co-directed by Ali Taner Baltaci, for which he won Best Actor at the 34th Brussels International Independent Film Festival and 12th Sadri Alisik Awards. He has since repeated his box office success with a sequel to G.O.R.A. (2004) called A.R.O.G (2008), also co-directed by Ali Taner Baltaci, and comedy Western parody called Yahsi Bati - The Ottoman Cowboys (2009), directed by \u00d6mer Faruk Sorak. That same year, he co-starred, alongside veteran actor Sener Sen, in the police drama Hunting Season (2010), written and directed by Yavuz Turgul, and made a special appearance in drama Zefir (2010), written and directed by Belma Bas. After two years he also acted in Ferzan \u00d6zpetek's A Magnificent Haunting (2012). After he filmed his last stand-up comedy show CM101MMXI Fundamentals (2013) directed by Murat D\u00fcndar, he announced that for the next few years he will stop his stand-up comedy shows to have a rest.\n\nAlong his professional career, he has won numerous awards and appeared in more than 4000 stand-up comedy shows, took part in 10 movies and contributed as a dubbing performer in 4 movies.",

In contrast, his film Showgirls (1995) was poorly received and won seven Golden Raspberry Awards, but has become a cult film over time.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Paul Verhoeven, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia\u200b",

She has collaborated with Noah Baumbach on several films, including Greenberg (2010), Frances Ha (2012), for which she earned a Golden Globe nomination, and Mistress America (2015). Gerwig made her solo directorial debut with the critically acclaimed comedy-drama film Lady Bird (2017), which she also wrote, and has also had starring roles in the films Damsels in Distress (2011), Jackie (2016), and 20th Century Women (2016).\n\nGreta Celeste Gerwig was born in Sacramento, California, to Christine Gerwig (n\u00e9e Sauer), a nurse, and Gordon Gerwig, a financial consultant and computer programmer. She has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Gerwig was raised as a Unitarian Universalist, but also attended an all-girls Catholic school. She has described herself as \"an intense child\". With an early interest in dance, she intended to get a degree in musical theatre in New York. She graduated from Barnard College in NY, where she studied English and philosophy, instead.\n\nOriginally intending to become a playwright, after meeting young film director Joe Swanberg, she became the star of a series of intellectual low budget movies made by first-time filmmakers, a trend dubbed \"mumblecore\". Gerwig was cast in a minor role in Swanberg's LOL (2006) in 2006, while still studying at Barnard. She then appeared in many of Swanberg's films, and personally co-directed, co-wrote and co-produced one entitled Nights and Weekends (2008). She has worked with good quality directors such as Ti West (The House of the Devil (2009)), Whit Stillman (Damsels in Distress (2011)), or Woody Allen (To Rome with Love (2012)) but success and (international) recognition did not come until Frances Ha (2012), directed by Noah Baumbach, a film she also co-wrote. Both tall and immature, awkward and graceful, blundering and candid, annoying and engaging, Greta has won all hearts in the title role of Frances Ha(liday).\n\nIn 2017, she wrote and directed the highly acclaimed, semi-autobiographical teen movie Lady Bird (2017), set in 2002-2003, and starring Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. In 2011, Gerwig received an award for Acting from the Athena Film Festival for her artistry as one of Hollywood's definitive screen actresses of her generation.",

The success of her three short films, as well as the international acclaim of her award-winning 2005 documentary Women Without Shadows, influenced a whole new wave of Saudi filmmakers and made the issue of opening cinemas in the Kingdom a front-page discussion. Within the Kingdom her work is both praised and vilified for encouraging discussion on topics generally considered too taboo, like tolerance, the dangers of orthodoxy, and the need for Saudis to take a critical look at their traditional and restrictive culture.",

        "biography": "Between his birth on 6 September 1924 and his passing on 16 September 2006, Fouaad al-Mohandess made a major mark on Egyptian theatre, cinema, radio and television. Devoted since childhood to the performing arts, al-Mohandess' first introduction to the stage took the form of school plays, followed by university theatre at the Faculty of Commerce, Cairo University. Al-Mohandess modeled himself for a while on the great comedian Nagueeb al-Reehaany, rehearsals of whose troupe he regularly attended.\n\nIn 1953, al-Mohandess joined the radio program \u201cSaa'a le-albak i.e. An hour for your heart\u201d. Two years later, he was one of the co-founders of the \u201cSaa'a le-albak\u201d theatre troupe. He directed their first play, \u201cKaan mel-awwal i.e. It was about time\u201d, and performed in most of the productions subsequently staged by the troupe.\n\nThe next turning point in his career came when he began to perform in television-sponsored play productions. Roles in plays such as \u201cAna we howwa we heyya i.e. Me, he and she (1962)\u201d and \u201cAl-sekerteir al-fanny i.e. The technical secretary (1963)\u201d brought him to the attention of a large and appreciative audience. Then, in 1966, he co-founded the United Artists' troupe, taking leading roles in several of the plays staged by the troupe, among them \u201cAna we howwa we somowwo i.e. Me, he and his Highness (1966)\u201d and \u201cSayyedaty al-gameela - An adaptation of My Fair Lady (1968)\u201d which are considered by many the highpoint of his career on stage.\n\nIn 1971 El-Mohandess, with his then wife Shweikar, with whom he formed a very popular duo, joined the Egyptian Comedy troupe, participating in many of the comedies it staged, including \u201cHello, Dolly (1971)\u201d, \u201cLeih, leih i.e. Why! Oh Why? (1976) and \u201cEnnaha hakkan \u2018aaela mohtarama i.e. It's quite a respectable family (1978)\u201d.\n\nEl-Mohandess' first break on the big screen was in the 1953 film \u201cGhaltet \u2018omr i.e. The mistake of a lifetime\u201d, which he followed up a year later with a role in \u201cBent al-geiraan i.e. The neighbours' daughter (1954)\u201d. He played supporting roles in several successful films, including \u201cBayn al-atlaal i.e. Amid the ruins\u201d, \u201cNahr al-Hobb i.e. The river of love\u201d, Almaz wa \u2018Abdo al-Haamouly i.e. Almaz and \u2018Abdo al-Haamouly\u201d and \u201cShafeeka al-Kebteyya i.e. Shafeeka the Copt\u201d.",

Chu is an alumnus of the University of Southern California School of Cinema-Television. There, he won the Princess Grace Award, the Dore Schary Award presented by the Anti-Defamation League, the Jack Nicholson directing award, and was recognized as an honoree for the IFP/West program Project: Involve.\n\nAfter making his student short, \"When the Kids Are Away\", Chu was signed to William Morris Agency and attached to several high profile projects. Chu was hired by Sony Pictures to direct their feature Bye Bye Birdie but Sony never green lit the film due to budget concerns. Sony recently got back into business with Chu to direct their updated version of The Great Gatsby. He also is in a dance crew called AC/DC or Adam/Chu Dance crew. His father, Lawrence Chu, is a well-known chef and his parents own Chef Chu's, a popular restaurant in Los Altos, California. He also attended Pinewood School from kindergarten through 12th grade. Chu is currently directing the online series The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers.\n\nIn an interview, Chu addressed a question he is often asked, \"Why do all of your films have dance?\" He responded, \"I don\u2019t know why. It seems so obvious. But there\u2019s something about the dancers that motivate me the most. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just dance, but I do think that the dancers are amazing artists, and every time I meet a new dancer, that triggers something in my brain, and I\u2019m more creative than I could ever be. When I feel that creativity burst, I go with it.\"",

His first full-length movie, FUBAR was shot on a digital camera with a tiny budget, but was selected by the Sundance Film Festival and screened on the prestigious midnight slot, which had launched the revolutionary film The Blair Witch Project. Though it failed to get picked up by any major American theatrical distributors, FUBAR subsequently became a cult hit in Canada. Following the success of FUBAR, Dowse went on to direct the higher-budget British film \"It's All Gone Pete Tong\", the story of a deaf DJ in Ibiza.\n\nDowse's next production, the 1980s retro comedy Take Me Home Tonight, started shooting in Phoenix, Arizona on the week beginning 19 February 2007 and is scheduled to be released in 2011.\n\nHe currently resides in Montreal with his wife and child.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Michael Dowse, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

A character from this series, Alan Partridge, went on to feature in a number of Iannucci's television and radio programmes including Knowing Me, Knowing You and I'm Alan Partridge. In the meantime, Iannucci also fronted the satirical Armistice review shows and in 2001 created his most personal work, The Armando Iannucci Shows for Channel 4.\n\nMoving back to the BBC in 2005, Iannucci created the political sitcom The Thick of It as well as the spoof documentary Time Trumpet in 2006. Winning funding from the UK Film Council, he directed a critically acclaimed feature film In the Loop featuring characters from The Thick of It in 2009. As a result of these works, he has been being described by The Daily Telegraph as \"the hardman of political satire\".[2] Other works during this period include a operetta libretto, Skin Deep and his radio series Charm Offensive. He is currently working on a U.S. political satire for HBO called Veep.",

        "biography": "Manoj Nelliyattu \"M. Night\" Shyamalan, born August 6, 1970, is an American filmmaker and actor. He is known for making original films with contemporary supernatural plots and twist endings. He was born in Mah\u00e9, India, and raised in Penn Valley, Pennsylvania. The cumulative gross of his films exceeds $3 billion globally.\n\nHe made his directorial debut in 1992 with his first movie Praying with Anger. His second movie was the comedy-drama film Wide Awake (1998). His most well-received films include the supernatural thriller The Sixth Sense (1999), the superhero thriller Unbreakable (2000), and the science fiction thriller Signs (2002). For The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Afterward, Shyamalan released a series of poorly received but sometimes financially successful movies, including the period-piece thriller The Village (2004), the dark fantasy Lady in the Water (2006), the eco-thriller The Happening (2008), The Last Airbender (2010) (an adaptation based on the first season of the Nickelodeon animated television series Avatar: The Last Airbender), and the science fiction film After Earth (2013). Following the financial failure of After Earth, Shyamalan's career was revived with the release of the found-footage horror film The Visit (2015), the psychological thriller Split (2016), and the superhero thriller Glass (2019). With a total budget of $34 million between them, these three films earned a combined box office of $625 million. Glass is the third and final chapter of his Unbreakable film series, which commenced in 2000.\n\nIn addition to his directorial work, Shyamalan was a story creator and a producer for the horror film Devil (2010). Shyamalan was also called in for an uncredited rewrite for the teen film She's All That (1999) and also served as a writer for the film Stuart Little (1999). He is also one of the executive producers and occasional director of Wayward Pines and the critically acclaimed series Servant.\n\nShyamalan is also known for filming and setting his films in and around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Most of his commercially successful films were co-produced and released by Walt Disney Studios' Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures and Universal imprints. In 2008, Shyamalan was awarded the Padma Shri by the government of India.",

        "biography": "Cristi Puiu (Romanian pronunciation: [\u02c8kristi \u02c8puju]; born 3 April 1967; Bucharest) is a Romanian film director and screenwriter. With Anca Puiu and Alex Munteanu, in 2004 he founded a cinema production company, naming it Mandragora.\n\nCristian Emilian Puiu was born to Iuliana and Emilian Puiu in Bucharest, Romania. Puiu's first interest in art was painting. In 1992, he was admitted as a student to the Painting Department of \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure d'Arts Visuels in Geneva. After the first year he switched to film studies at the same school, where he graduated in 1996. He started working in film after his return to Romania.\n\nCristi Puiu's debut as a director was in 2001 with the low-budget road movie Stuff and Dough (Marfa \u0219i banii), starring Alexandru Papadopol and Drago\u0219 Bucur. The film received several awards in international film festivals and competed in the Quinzaines des Realisateurs section of the Cannes Film Festival. Some critics say that this is the film that started the Romanian New Wave in cinema. He continued with a short film, Cigarettes and Coffee (Un cartu\u015f de Kent \u0219i un pachet de cafea) (2004), which was awarded the Golden Bear for best short film at the 2004 Berlin International Film Festival. His second feature film, The Death of Mr. L\u0103z\u0103rescu (Moartea domnului L\u0103z\u0103rescu) (2005), was a dark comedy about an ailing old man who is carried by an ambulance from hospital to hospital all night long, as doctors refuse to treat him and send him away. The film was a critical success, being awarded the Prix Un Certain Regard at the Cannes Film Festival and numerous awards at other international film festivals. In 2006 this film gained 47 prizes, several nominations in the American Critics' Top 10 lists and in French magazines such as Telerama and Les Inrockuptibles.",

        "biography": "Madonna (born Madonna Louise Ciccone) is a recording artist, actress and entrepreneur. Born in Bay City, Michigan, she moved to New York City in 1977 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing in the music groups Breakfast Club and Emmy, she released her debut album in 1983. She followed it with a series of albums in which she found immense popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on MTV. Throughout her career, many of her songs have hit number one on the record charts, including \"Like a Virgin\", \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"Like a Prayer\", \"Vogue\", \"Frozen\", \"Music\", \"Hung Up\", and \"4 Minutes\". Critics have praised Madonna for her diverse musical productions while at the same time serving as a lightning rod for religious controversy.\n\nHer career was further enhanced by film appearances that began in 1979, despite mixed commentary. She won critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her role in Evita (1996), but has received harsh feedback for other film roles. Madonna's other ventures include being a fashion designer, children's book author, film director and producer. She has been acclaimed as a businesswoman, and in 2007, she signed an unprecedented US $120 million contract with Live Nation.\n\nMadonna has sold more than 300 million records worldwide and is recognized as the world's top-selling female recording artist of all time by the Guinness World Records. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century and the second top-selling female artist in the United States, behind Barbra Streisand, with 64 million certified albums. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked Madonna at number two, behind only The Beatles, on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, making her the most successful solo artist in the history of the Billboard chart. She was also inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the same year. Considered to be one of the \"25 Most Powerful Women of the Past Century\" by Time for being an influential figure in contemporary music, Madonna is known for continuously reinventing both her music and image, and for retaining a standard of autonomy within the recording industry.",

She has been cited as one of the world's most beautiful women and her off-screen life is widely reported.\n\nThough she made her screen debut as a child alongside her father Jon Voight in the 1982 film Lookin' to Get Out, Jolie's acting career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993). Her first leading role in a major film was in Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie achieved wider fame after her portrayal of video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), and since then has established herself as one of the best-known and highest-paid actresses in Hollywood. She has had her biggest commercial successes with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) and the animated film Kung Fu Panda (2008).\n\nDivorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, Jolie currently lives with actor Brad Pitt, in a relationship that has attracted worldwide media attention. Jolie and Pitt have three adopted children, Maddox, Pax, and Zahara, as well as three biological children, Shiloh, Knox, and Vivienne.",

Miss Americana was a New York Times Critic's Pick, an IndieWire Critic's Pick, and was named one of the Five Best Documentaries of the Year by the National Board of Review.\n\nWilson's previous feature film, The Departure (2017), about a punk-turned-priest in Japan, was critically acclaimed for being a poetic, profound, and moving exploration of what makes life worth living.

The Departure was called \"A work of art\" by the San Francisco Chronicle, \"A genuinely spiritual experience\" by the Washington Post, and \"Tender and moving...like a haiku\" by the New York Times. The film was acquired by FilmRise and theatrically released in 30 US cities, beginning with a held-over run at New York's Metrograph. The Departure has a rare 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"\n\nWilson's first film, After Tiller (2013), goes inside the lives of the four most-targeted abortion providers in the country, taking a powerful and complex look at one of the most incendiary issues of our time. After Tiller premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2013, and went on to win an Emmy Award for Best Documentary. It was also nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary, four Cinema Eye Honors, a Satellite Award, and the Ridenhour Prize. After Tiller was acquired by Oscilloscope and released in theaters in 50 US cities. The film was named one of the five best documentaries of the year by the National Board of Review, and featured in \"Best of 2013\" lists in the LA Times, Village Voice, Indiewire, Artforum, and more. Flavorwire named it one of the \"50 Best Documentaries of All Time.\"\n\nWilson also works in episodic and short-form filmmaking.

        "biography": "David Keith Lynch (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, painter, visual artist, musician, actor, and writer. Known for his surrealist films, he has developed his own unique cinematic style, which has been dubbed \"Lynchian\", and which is characterized by its dream imagery and meticulous sound design. Indeed, the surreal and in many cases violent elements to his films have earned them the reputation that they \"disturb, offend or mystify\" their audiences.\n\nMoving around various parts of the United States as a child within his middle class family, Lynch went on to study painting in Philadelphia, where he first made the transition to producing short films. Deciding to devote himself more fully to this medium, he moved to Los Angeles, where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror Eraserhead (1977). After Eraserhead became a cult classic on the midnight movie circuit, Lynch was employed to direct The Elephant Man (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. Then being employed by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, he proceeded to make two films. First, the science-fiction epic Dune (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a neo-noir crime film, Blue Velvet (1986), which was highly critically acclaimed.\n\nProceeding to create his own television series with Mark Frost, the highly popular murder mystery Twin Peaks (1990\u20131992), he also created a cinematic prequel, Fire Walk With Me (1992), a road movie, Wild at Heart (1990), and a family film, The Straight Story (1999) in the same period.

NHK quickly contacted Atsuko with an offer to have her animate a music video segment for the popular and long running short film program Minna no Uta (Everyone's Songs), which was designed to highlight upcoming independent animators and musicians. However, by this time Ishizuka had already been hired by Madhouse as a production assistant, and feeling that it would not be right to accept freelance work outside of the studio, she turned them down. However, the Minna no Uta staff was unwilling to give up, and they requested that Madhouse take on the music video project with Ishizuka as director. The studio agreed, and in 2004, Atsuko rose through the ranks for her first professional film, The Moon Waltz.",

He is best known for co-creating the Comedy Central series Chappelle's Show.\n\nBrennan and Dave Chappelle met when both were aspiring stand-ups. Through his older brother, an established stand up comedian and comedy writer Kevin Brennan, Brennan got a part-time job working as the doorman at Boston Comedy Club in New York City where Chappelle was a frequent performer. They became good friends and collaborated on jokes. They co-wrote the film Half-Baked which starred Chappelle. In an interview on Inside the Actor's Studio, Chappelle admitted that he and Brennan could not help but see each other as a painful reminder of the box-office failure of Half-Baked and lost touch with each other. Four years later, they rekindled their partnership to create the sketch comedy show, Chappelle's Show, which premiered in January 2003. The duo wrote the sketches themselves with very little outside help.\n\nBrennan is frequently mentioned during Chappelle's stand-up routines.\n\nOn an interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show on February 9, 2006, Chappelle stated that Brennan made no attempt to contact him, despite the numerous media reports that Chappelle went to Africa to escape the pressures of running a high-profile show. \"How many times do you think he's called his sick buddy since he went to Africa?\",\n\nIn an interview in the July 2006 issue of Maxim Magazine, when asked if he would ever work with Chappelle again, he said there was \"no chance.\"\n\nNeal Brennan was recently accused of credited for writing comedy material for the 83rd Academy Awards. In May, 2011, he wrote material for his friend Seth Meyers at the White House Correspondents dinner.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Neal Brennan, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Working at Kyoto Animation, she directed the K-On! and Tamako Market anime series, and the anime films A Silent Voice and Liz and the Blue Bird.\n\nYamada intended to work in film after university, but she decided to join Kyoto Animation after seeing an advertisement. Her first assignment at KyoAni was drawing inbetween frames for Inuyasha. She was eventually promoted to a key animator for Air.\n\nAfter working as an episode director of Clannad, she was asked to make her chief directorial debut with K-On!, an adaptation of a slice-of-life manga. The series was very successful, spurring a second season and a film. In 2013, she directed Tamako Market, and followed it with the film Tamako Love Story in 2014. For Tamako Love Story, she was awarded the New Face Award at the Japan Media Arts Festival. She storyboarded the entire film herself, and also wrote the lyrics for the opening theme song, Everybody Loves Somebody. Yamada's next project was the feature film A Silent Voice, an adaptation of the manga of the same name, that reflected on elements of bullying and physical impairment in Japan. The film opened at #2 in the Japanese Box Office and grossed a total of \u00a52.3 billion, the 19th highest-grossing film in Japan in 2016. The film also received multiple award nominations, including Best Animation Film in the Mainichi Film Awards and the Excellent Animation of the Year in the Japan Academy Prize.\n\nFor Yamada, the most important part of being a director is to observe people. She describes herself as a \"method\" director, emphasizing the minds of the characters.\n\nOn July 18, 2019, a man started a fire at the main studio of Kyoto Animation, killing 36 of Yamada's colleagues and wounding 33 others. Yamada was reported not to have been hurt in the fire. In 2020, Yamada left KyoAni to join Science SARU, where she directed 2021's The Heike Story.\n\nSource: Wikipedia",

Zhang has won numerous awards and recognitions, with Best Foreign Film nominations for Ju Dou in 1990 and Raise the Red Lantern in 1991, Silver Lion and Golden Lion prizes at the Venice Film Festival, Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. One of Zhang's recurrent themes is the resilience of Chinese people in the face of hardship and adversity, a theme which has been explored in such films as, for example, To Live (1994) and Not One Less (1999). His films are particularly noted for their rich use of colour, as can be seen in some of his early films, like Raise the Red Lantern, and in his wuxia films like Hero and House of Flying Daggers.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Zhang Yimou, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

Following this achievement, he filmed Winston (1987), the short-subject film that he would later expand into Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989). Over the next six years, he was married to actress Betsy Brantley and had a daughter named Sarah.",

He collaborated with Adam Sandler (executive producer of \"Grandma's Boy\") on the album \"Shhh...Don't Tell\" as a writer and co-producer in addition to performing on the track \"Gay Robot\".\n\nGoossen directed the music video for the album's first single \"Secret\". It features Adam Sandler and comedian Nick Swardson (Co-writer and star of \"Grandma's Boy\") singing about the benefits of having trimmed pubic hair.\n\nGoossen's previous credits include the short film A Day With the Meatball, which once again featured Sandler but focused primarily on his bulldog Meatball. The two minute piece showcases the dog meandering around various places until he ends up back in his master's arms. It was shown in theaters around the United States in 2002 as an attachment to Sandler's animated film \"Eight Crazy Nights\".\n\nGoossen helped create Sandler's official website and directed several short films for the site.\n\nGoossen is currently filming his next project, \"The Shortcut\" in Saskatchewan, Canada. The film tells the story of two brothers who learn first hand about an urban legend surrounding a shortcut near their school.\n\nIn 2010, Goossen was the director of a Times Square interactive billboard installation for retailer Forever 21 which was developed by space150; the installation received media coverage for being \"a clever, fresh project\", but later, coverage focused on its similarities to Chris O'Shea's 2009 project in London.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Nicholaus Goossen, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\n\n\u200b",

Armed with a wit as sharp as a well-honed butter knife, he conquered the world of comedy like a mad scientist concocting the perfect joke in his lab.\n\nWith a podcast empire that could rival an overzealous monarch's reign, Scott pioneered the world of improvised comedy podcasts, where the bizarre meets the brilliant, and spontaneity reigns supreme. His shows are a delightful rollercoaster ride through the absurd, complete with hilarious characters and offbeat humour that's a sanctuary for the eccentric and a refuge for the wonderfully weird.\n\nScott Aukerman, the comedic maestro with a penchant for the peculiar, continues to captivate audiences with his infectious humour, proving that in this crazy world, laughter truly is the best medicine\u2014preferably taken in large doses, delivered by a master jokester like Scott.\n\nScott is married to actress, former girlfriend, and fellow podcaster Kulap Vilaysack.

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nDanny Cannon (born 1968, in Luton, England) is a film and television screenwriter, director and producer.\n\nCannon began making films at the age of 16 in 1984, and started a youth experimental theatre group at 33 Arts Centre. Using the centre's facilities, he was a very prolific director of video dramas and collaborated with a number of other directors in different roles including cameraman. A major influence was the centre's video maker, Dermot Byrne with whom he worked on a number of projects. It was at 33 that he met the future film composer David Arnold who played in a band that rehearsed there. Cannon convinced Arnold that he could compose soundtracks for his and other people's videos. Arnold's first but not the last soundtrack for Byrne was 'The Undead' written by Keith Moyes.\n\nIn 1987 Cannon, then a teenager, entered a competition in the British comic 2000 AD to design a poster for a possible future film of Judge Dredd. His work was published in the comic's \"Prog 534\" edition. In his poster, a clearly Blade Runner\u2013inspired Cannon imagined that the director of the film would be Ridley Scott, with Harrison Ford starring in the title role and Daryl Hannah co-starring as \"PSI Anderson\".\n\nBy 1987 he was awarded the BBC Young Filmmaker of the Year Award for a 40-minute short called Sometimes. He enrolled at the National Film and Television School in 1988, from which he graduated in 1990.\n\nHe wrote and directed Strangers (1990) and The Young Americans (1993), the latter having as its title song, \"Play Dead\", sung by Icelandic diva Bj\u00f6rk. Based on his work on the later gangster film, producers signed him to direct the big-budget, but ultimately poorly received film Judge Dredd (1995), starring Sylvester Stallone. Since then he has also directed Phoenix (1998), and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998). Beginning in 2000, he has directed and produced various CSI television series. In 2005 he directed Goal!. Cannon also plays football regularly with Hollywood United F.C. The team mostly features celebrities and former professional footballers. They do however, occasionally play against professional teams for friendly matches and charity events.\n\nHe directed a 2006 CBS television pilot, Capital Law, about a group of legal associates trying to make partner at a powerful Washington, D.C.\u2013based law firm. More recently, Cannon co-created TNT's crime drama series starring Dylan McDermott, called Dark Blue. Cannon also directed the pilot episode for Dark Blue.\n\nIn 2010, Cannon joined The CW action series Nikita, as director and executive producer.\n\nIn 2011, Cannon executive produced and directed the pilot for the FOX crime/mystery Alcatraz.",

So, he started his work from the scratch entering into global ad competitions and making short films. He won International awards twice for Mofilm in Goa and Kathmandu festivals, which has hosts like Jon Landau, Forest Whitaker, Jesse Eisenberg etc. in 2010 and 2011 consecutively, which bagged him a place in top 10 Mofilm Indian filmmakers at the very beginning of his career. He then understood the intensity and benefits of learning by self, the freedom to make mistakes and bettering the craft everyday. This made him to experiment more. So, he came out with an experiment with his very first short film Backspace, which he completely shot, edited and dubbed using only an IPhone 4s, which was the first of its kind then, which later inspired many other enthusiasts around him to take a dry run.",

At 16 she received a full scholarship to study in the United States and made Texas her home. After graduating high school Alex began interning at the European Parliament and created several documentaries and short narratives in Moscow, Dominican Republic, Belarus, Turkey and Italy that explored human rights issues. During that time she began to develop her voice as a female filmmaker and to seriously consider pursuing a film degree. In 2009 she graduated with honors from America's top-rated film school at the University of Southern California. She has assisted award-winning directors and worked on major productions such as Lucasfilm\u2019s CLONE WARS, and the Coen Brothers' TRUE GRIT. Alex\u2019s recent accolades stem from her latest short films Lonely Planet and Pale Blue, which has screened at dozens of festivals worldwide, including Oscar-qualifying festivals such as Los Angeles International Shortfest and Palm Springs International Shortfest, Newport Beach and Soho International. Most recently she directed a female-driven series for Lifetime and A&E digital platform and is currently developing her first feature film.",

        "biography": "Gerardo Olivares (born 1964) is a Spanish filmmaker and screenwriter. He is married with two children and lives in Madrid. He was the first Spanish man to win the Golden Spike at the prestigious Seminci film festival in Valladolid for his film \"14 kil\u00f3metros\". He received the 2019 Cinema for Peace Award for Justice for his film 'Two Catalonias'.\n\nA tireless traveler, Olivares began to travel the world in 1987 while studying Information Science at the Complutense University of Madrid. At the age of twenty he borrowed a Vespa motorcycle from his brother and for four months traveled in the North Cape in Lapland, where he did his first reportage on the nomads who live beyond the Arctic Circle. Back in Madrid, the report was published in Los Aventureros (The Adventurer). Months later he started working under the direction of the journalist and writer Enrique Meneses, whom he has always considered his master.\n\nA year later Olivares covered a good part of the Sahara with a Seat Panda, a desert he later crossed on multiple occasions. During this trip he began to mature what would be his first major documentary project, La Ruta de las C\u00f3rdobas (The Cordobas Route), a trip from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, following the 36 cities, towns and geographical features with the name of Cordoba. For a year and a half he traveled along the spine of the Americas in three all-terrain vehicles, and the result was a series of 8 episodes issued in 1992 by TVE with great ratings success.\n\nTwo years later, in 1994, Olivares encircled the continent of Africa by land, from Morocco to South Africa and then to Egypt, as Director of Ruta de los Exploradores (Path of the Explorers), co-produced by TVE. In 1997 he traveled across the Asian continent from Spain to Singapore in two trucks for the series Road to Samarkand, the most watched program of 2000 in TVE 2, winning the GECA award for a record audience.\n\nIn 2005, after a long career directing and writing documentaries, Olivares decided to jump into fiction with the help of producer Jose Maria Morales (Wanda Films) with La Gran final (The Great Match), shot in Mongolia, the Sahara and Brazilian Amazon. This film won several international awards and was selected to participate, among others, in the Berlin International Film Festival. The film was an official selection at the Copenhagen International Film Festival, the Galway Film Fleadh, the World Cinema Festival, Cap Ttown and the Desert Nights Filmfest, Rome. It was nominated for Best Film at the Malaga Spanish Film Festival.\n\nIn 2006 he wrote and directed 14 kil\u00f3metros, a film about the plight of African immigration that has won over 15 international awards, affirming him as one of the most committed filmmakers in the panorama of Spanish cinema. His 2010 feature film, Entrelobos (Among wolves), based on the remarkable story of Marcos Rodr\u00edguez Pantoja, has been one of the highest grossing Spanish films of 2010 with more than half a million viewers in theaters. It tells the true story of a young shepherd in a remote mountain area who befriends a pack of wolves and eventually becomes their leader.\n\nSource: Article \"Gerardo Olivares\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",

        "biography": "Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter (born September 4, 1981), often known simply as Beyonc\u00e9, is an American R&B and pop recording artist and actress.\n\nBorn and raised in Houston, Texas, she enrolled in various performing arts schools and was first exposed to singing and dancing competitions as a child. Knowles rose to fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&B girl group Destiny's Child, one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. During the hiatus of Destiny's Child, Knowles released her debut solo album Dangerously in Love (2003), which spawned the number one hits \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\" and became one of the most successful albums of that year, earning her a then record-tying five Grammy Awards.\n\nFollowing the group's disbandment in 2005, Knowles released B'Day in 2006. It debuted at number one on the Billboard charts and included the hits \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\", \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Beautiful Liar\". Her third solo album I Am... Sasha Fierce, released in November 2008, included the anthemic \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". The album and its singles earned her six Grammy Awards, breaking the record for most Grammy Awards won by a female artist in one night. Knowles is one of the most honored artists by the Grammys with 16 awards\u201413 as a solo artist and three as a member of Destiny's Child.\n\nKnowles began her acting career in 2001, appearing in the musical film Carmen: A Hip Hopera. In 2006, she starred in the lead role in the film adaptation of the 1981 Broadway musical Dreamgirls, for which she earned two Golden Globe nominations. Knowles launched her family's fashion line, House of Der\u00e9on, in 2004, and has endorsed such brands as Pepsi, Tommy Hilfiger, Armani and L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nIn 2010, Forbes ranked Knowles at number two on its list of the 100 Most Powerful and Influential Celebrities in the world; she was also listed as the most powerful and influential musician in the world. Time also included Knowles on its list of the \"100 Most Influential People in the World\". Knowles has attained five Hot 100 number one singles as a solo performer and four with Destiny's Child, and as a solo artist, has sold over 35 million albums and singles in the U.S.; according to Sony, her total record sales, when combined with the group, have surpassed 100 million. On December 11, 2009, Billboard listed Knowles as the most successful female artist of the 2000s decade and the top Radio Artist of the decade. In February 2010, the RIAA listed her as the top certified artist of the decade.",

She moved to New York City after college, where she studied at the William Esper Studio for two years and worked as a bartender and a waitress. Through her father, she is the niece of Chuck Schumer, U.S. Senator from New York.\n\nAmy Schumer portrayed a young woman diagnosed with breast cancer in the off-Broadway black comedy Keeping Abreast. She started doing stand-up comedy on June 1, 2004, when she first performed at Gotham Comedy Club. She recorded a special for Comedy Central before appearing on Last Comic Standing; she said in August 2012 that she thought of the special as her \"big break\".\n\nAfter not passing an audition for an earlier season, she advanced to the finals of the fifth season of the NBC reality television talent show Last Comic Standing and placed fourth. Schumer said in April 2011, \"Last Comic was totally fun. I had a great time because there was no pressure on me; I had been doing stand-up around two years. I wasn't supposed to do well. So every time I advanced it was a happy surprise. I kept it honest on the show and it served me well.\" (Wikipedia)",

They began their career in TV in 1999, when they created and produced Televisi\u00f3n Abierta, an innovative and interactive TV show where the viewers created the content by requesting a cameraman to visit them to record a short clip (less than a minute). They both won the Konex Award Merit Diploma in 2002.\n\nGast\u00f3n and Mariano met during a regional experimental video festival in Buenos Aires back in 1993, where Gast\u00f3n was a member of the jury and Mariano was in competition with his video Un d\u00eda m\u00e1s en la tierra. They began exchanging ideas after the event and started to work on new projects. They have been creative and business partners since then. In the fields of experimental film and video they have created more than twenty works that have been seen in movie theaters, art-house venues and museums around the world. Some of the better known titles are: C\u00e1mara de sombra (1990), Circuito (1993), Venimos llenos de Tierra (1996), Hect\u00e1rea (1998), Soy Francisco L\u00f3pez (2000), 20/12 (2001) and H\u00e1galo usted mismo (2002).\n\nIn the area of the feature films they started directing Enciclopedia (1998) and Yo Presidente (2006); a feature documentary film coproduced with journalist Luis Majul and Patagonik (Disney Films) that obtained the First Prize in the International Festival of Independent Cinema from Mexico and the Best Prize for Documentary Film at the Malaga Film Festival.

In The Distinguished Citizen (Spanish: El ciudadano ilustre, 2016), a Nobel Prize winning author living in Barcelona is invited back to his Argentine hometown to accept honors, jury an art show, and deliver lectures, while facing both the reverence and contempt of the townspeople he used as the basis for his novels.

Medem was born in San Sebasti\u00e1n, Basque Country and showed an interest in movies since childhood, when he would take his father's Super 8 camera and shoot at night, while nobody was paying attention. After college graduation (where he earned degrees in Medicine and General Surgery) he worked as a film critic and later as a screenwriter, assistant director and editor. After a few shorts he directed his first full length feature, Vacas ('Cows') for which he won a Goya Award. After this film he directed The Red Squirrel and Earth, both receiving good reviews at Cannes. In his next movie, Lovers of the Arctic Circle, which has been compared to the works of Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, he explored circular narrative and a taste for minimalistic textures that he then overcame in his next film, Sex and Lucia, where the plot dissolves into a very lyrical eroticism. After this film he took a tangent from his style to direct and produce La pelota vasca ('The Basque Ball'), a documentary film about the political problems of the Basque Country, which caused a furor amongst Spain's right wing politicians. Following this, his film Ca\u00f3tica Ana debuted in 2007.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Julio Medem, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Born in Israel, Murro originally trained as an architect in his boyhood town of Jerusalem, NY, then entered the advertising industry, with a lengthy tenure in the creative department of Gotham's Goldsmith/Jeffrey Agency. During that stint, he became known for his deft and original hand at directing promotional films via his own production banner, Biscuit Films (co-run with Shawn Lacy Tessaro); their clients included such brands as Saturn, E*Trade, and FreeAgent.com. In time, Murro and Tessaro migrated to the advertising-based production house Stiefel &amp; Co., in Southern California, then set up a new production banner for themselves. In the years to follow, talk swirled of Murro's pending feature activity -- including, at one point, his plans to direct\u00a0The Ring Two\u00a0for DreamWorks (an assignment eventually handled by\u00a0Hideo Nakata, the director of the original Japanese film) and the black comedy All Families Are Psychotic; however, Murro eventually took his first high-profile feature bow with the 2007 comedy\u00a0Smart People. The film stars\u00a0Thomas Haden Church,\u00a0Dennis Quaid, and\u00a0Sarah Jessica Parker, and concerns a professor (Quaid) who grapples with a new romance and the doings of a shady brother.",

He founded the heavy metal band White Zombie and has been nominated eight times for the Grammy Award for Best Metal or Hard Rock Performance.\n\nZombie directed the horror film House of 1000 Corpses in 2000, though the controversial project was not released until 2003, and has since been described as a cult classic. Zombie followed the film with two sequels in his \"Firefly\" trilogy: The Devil's Rejects (2005) and 3 From Hell (2019). After the success of his first two films he directed Halloween (2007), a remake of the classic 1978 horror film. The film became his highest-grossing to date, though was generally received negatively by critics. He later directed Halloween II (2009), which failed to match the commercial success of its predecessor. Zombie has also directed the films The Haunted World of El Superbeasto (2009), The Lords of Salem (2012), 31 (2016), and The Munsters (2022).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Rob Zombie, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia .",

Noted for his innovative dramatic productions as well as his distinctive voice and personality, Welles is widely acknowledged as one of the most accomplished dramatic artists of the twentieth century, especially for his significant and influential early work\u2014despite his notoriously contentious relationship with Hollywood. His distinctive directorial style featured layered, nonlinear narrative forms, innovative uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unique camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots, and long takes. Welles's long career in film is noted for his struggle for artistic control in the face of pressure from studios. Many of his films were heavily edited and others left unreleased. He has been praised as a major creative force and as \"the ultimate auteur.\"\n\nAfter directing a number of high-profile theatrical productions in his early twenties, including an innovative adaptation of Macbeth and The Cradle Will Rock, Welles found national and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells's novel The War of the Worlds performed for the radio drama anthology series Mercury Theatre on the Air. It was reported to have caused widespread panic when listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was occurring. Although these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated, they rocketed Welles to instant notoriety.\n\nCitizen Kane (1941), his first film with RKO, in which he starred in the role of Charles Foster Kane, is often considered the greatest film ever made. Several of his other films, including The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Touch of Evil (1958), Chimes at Midnight (1965), and F for Fake (1974), are also widely considered to be masterpieces.\n\nIn 2002, he was voted the greatest film director of all time in two separate British Film Institute polls among directors and critics, and a wide survey of critical consensus, best-of lists, and historical retrospectives calls him the most acclaimed director of all time. Andrew Sarris in his influential book of film criticism The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929\u20131968 included him in the \"pantheon\" of the 14 greatest film directors who had worked in the United States. Well known for his baritone voice, Welles was also an extremely well regarded actor and was voted number 16 in AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars list of the greatest American film actors of all time. He was also a celebrated Shakespearean stage actor and an accomplished magician, starring in troop variety shows in the war years.",

Born in Punjab, Raz left India at a young age for the United Kingdom, where he grew up. He acquired national prominence as an exceptional hockey player in the Midlands.\n\nHe attended university in the San Francisco Bay area. Raz was a founder and artistic director of The Wandering Players Theater Company. The Company staged several World and US premieres of plays from India. Western audiences were exposed to the works of Rabindranath Tagore for the first time, in addition to plays like Sakharam Binder and Shakuntala. This was the first professional South Asian theatre company in the USA.\n\nIn the mid-seventies, Raz arrived in Hollywood: a career as an actor was unheard of at a time when roles for South Asian actors in Hollywood television shows and films were limited. Raz had been quoted: \u201cPeople, especially friends and relatives scoffed at the idea of my becoming an actor. They thought it was a passing fancy and would soon be over. But no, I had a dream and take what it may I journeyed on to make my dream a reality.\u201d\n\nHe became the first ever South Asian actor to be signed on as a regular in a major TV series, St Elsewhere. He was a cast member for the first two seasons of the medical drama, and after being let go continued to appear on a recurring basis.\n\nRaz has appeared in over 200 plays, TV shows and films, including guest appearances on The A-Team, M*A*S*H and Star Trek: The Next Generation.\n\nIn 1978, Raz founded the production company, K.R. Films Hollywood. Its debut, Lehren - a television weekly variety series for the Asian audience - was shown throughout the United States and Canada. In 1988, K.R. Studios was built in Granada Hills. Housing several buildings including the main studio, it has state-of-art equipment for film and television productions, as well as a multi-track recording facility for post production and recording needs. The studio is now home to many award winning producers, writers and directors engaged in the production of commercials, TV programmes, music videos and films.\n\nRaz began his career as a filmmaker with The Gold Bracelet, a movie about a Sikh man faced with the realities of post-9/11.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kavi Raz, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In a career spanning twenty five years, he has performed and designed a wide range of dancing styles and has garnered two National Film Awards for Best Choreography.\n\nInspired by his father, Mugur Sundar, a choreographer for South Indian movies, and took up dancing learning Indian classical dance forms such as Bharatanatyam from Dharmaraj and Udupi Lakshminarayanan as well as Western styles. \n\nPrabhu Deva first appeared as a boy playing a flute in the song \"Panivizhum Iravu\" from the Tamil film Mouna Ragam (1986).[7][8] He later appeared as a background dancer for a song in the 1988 Tamil film Agni Natchathiram. Deva's first venture as a choreographer was the Kamal Haasan starrer Vetri Vizha (1989).\n\nBeginning with a series of acting roles in the 1990s and early 2000s, Prabhu Deva featured in several commercially successful films including Kadhalan (1994), Minsara Kanavu (1997) and VIP (1997). After further critically acclaimed performances in the comedy Kaathala Kaathala (1998) and the family drama Vanathai Pola (2000), Deva then failed to recreate the success of his earlier films and his box office value began to decline and he subsequently made appearances in supporting roles and low budget Telugu language films. He then successfully ventured into direction with the 2005 Telugu film Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana, and the success of the project prompted further offers for Deva as a director. He then went on to make highly profitable films in Telugu, Hindi and Tamil languages such as Pokkiri (2007), Wanted (2009), Rowdy Rathore (2012) and Singh is Bling (2015).",

In 2006 he directed, co-wrote, co-produced, and co-starred in his first film The Foot Fist Way, which he based on his experience as a Taekwondo black belt and instructor. His follow-up film, Observe and Report, stars Seth Rogen and was released on April 10, 2009. Hill is also co-creator and executive producer of the HBO series Eastbound & Down.\n\nThe Foot Fist Way was seen by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay who bought the distributing rights to the film. This led to a cult following. He was invited to the set of Knocked Up where he met future collaborator, Seth Rogen. Hill was asked to do a cameo appearance with writing partner Ben Best in Rogen's next film, Superbad as Tut Long John Silver. Hill later cast Rogen as the leading man in his film, Observe and Report which opened at number 4 at the box office. The role of Ronnie was written specifically for Rogen. Hill is married to Collette Wolfe, who is an actress also seen in his movies Observe and Report and The Foot Fist Way.\n\nIn 2010, Hill directed the parody music video Swagger Wagon as part of ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi's campaign for the Sienna SE minivan from Toyota.\n\nHill's next film L.A.P.I. was announced as an action comedy about a hardboiled private investigator, played by friend and frequent collaborator Danny McBride. It is the first film Hill has directed but not written. The script was written by Michael Diliberti and Matthew Sullivan, who have written two scripts on the 2009 Black List: Comi-Con and a remake of Brewster's Millions. It is also the first film produced by Hill's, McBride's, and friend David Gordon Green's new production company, Rough House Pictures. L.A.P.I. is announced for release in 2011.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jody Hill, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Hayao Miyazaki (Miyazaki Hayao, born January 5, 1941) is a Japanese manga artist and prominent film director and animator of many popular anime feature films. Through a career that has spanned nearly five decades, Miyazaki has attained international acclaim as a maker of animated feature films and, along with Isao Takahata, co-founded Studio Ghibli, an animation studio and production company. The success of Miyazaki's films has invited comparisons with American animator Walt Disney, British animator Nick Park as well as Robert Zemeckis, who pioneered Motion Capture animation, and he has been named one of the most influential people by Time Magazine.\n\nMiyazaki began his career at Toei Animation as an in-between artist for Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon where he pitched his own ideas that eventually became the movie's ending. He continued to work in various roles in the animation industry over the decade until he was able to direct his first feature film Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro which was published in 1979. After the success of his next film, Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind, he co-founded Studio Ghibli where he continued to produce many feature films until Princess Mononoke whereafter he temporarily retired.\n\nWhile Miyazaki's films have long enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan, he remained largely unknown to the West until Miramax released his 1997 film, Princess Mononoke. Princess Mononoke was the highest-grossing film in Japan\u2014until it was eclipsed by another 1997 film, Titanic\u2014and the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards. Miyazaki returned to animation with Spirited Away. The film topped Titanic's sales at the Japanese box office, also won Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards and was the first anime film to win an American Academy Award.\n\nMiyazaki's films often incorporate recurrent themes, such as humanity's relationship to nature and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic. Reflecting Miyazaki's feminism, the protagonists of his films are often strong, independent girls or young women. Miyazaki is a vocal critic of capitalism and globalization. While two of his films, The Castle of Cagliostro and Castle in the Sky, involve traditional villains, his other films such as Nausicaa or Princess Mononoke present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities.",

Upon entering Bollywood, he has mostly remade popular comedy films from Malayalam cinema, some from his own work and some from others. These include Hera Pheri, Hungama, Hulchul, Garam Masala, Bhagam Bhag, Chup Chup Ke, Dhol, and Bhool Bhulaiyaa.

Later, Montiel would gain notoriety in 1989 when Geffen Records signed his newly formed outfit Gutterboy to a $1 million record deal \u2013 an unheard of sum at the time. The band was dropped after its debut and was dubbed one of the most \"successful\" unsuccessful bands in rock history.\n\nIn 2003, Montiel published A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, a memoir detailing his life growing up in Astoria, Queens in the early 1980s during the rise of the hardcore punk scene. The book describes his time spent touring with his band Gutterboy and his brief modeling career with Versace along with other personal anecdotes.\n\nAfter adapting his best-selling book into a screenplay, Montiel made his directorial debut with the film version of A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, with Robert Downey Jr. (as the older Montiel), Dianne Wiest and Shia LaBeouf. The film was executive produced by Trudie Styler.\n\nMontiel released the self-titled album Dito Montiel in 2006 through Rhino Records. His second novel Eddie Krumble Is the Clapper was published in April 2007.\n\nMontiel also directed a film, Fighting, about a young street hawker in New York City who is introduced to the world of underground street fighting. The film stars Channing Tatum, Terrence Howard and Luis Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nIn 2011, Montiel's police drama The Son of No One, featuring Channing Tatum, Ray Liotta, Al Pacino and Katie Holmes played at the Sundance Film Festival. The film was picked up for distribution by Anchor Bay Entertainment.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Dito Montiel, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Many of his films, such as Gattaca, S1m0ne and The Truman Show view societal or political issues through a fantasy-science fiction lens. Lord of War, however, was a contemporary, matter-of-fact exploration of gunrunning.\n\nNiccol was born in Paraparaumu, New Zealand in 1964 and grew up in Auckland, where he attended Auckland Grammar School. He left New Zealand at age 21 and began directing commercials in London, England. During the production of S1m0ne, he met model Rachel Roberts, with whom he has a son, Jack in 2003, and a daughter, Ava in 2008.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Andrew Niccol, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His mother was a Holocaust survivor. He moved to Berlin in the 1980s.\n\nLevy's films include 'RobbyKallePaul', 'I Was on Mars', 'Meschugge', 'Du mich auch' and 'V\u00e4ter'. 'V\u00e4ter' starred Christiane Paul. In 2004, he directed 'Alles auf Zucker!', a comedy about a secularised Jew from the former GDR who has to reconcile himself with his Orthodox brother. In 2007, he directed the comedy-drama 'Mein F\u00fchrer \u2013 Die wirklich wahrste Wahrheit \u00fcber Adolf Hitler', about a Jewish actor hired to enliven Adolf Hitler's speeches during the final days of World War II, starring German comedian Helge Schneider. It was entered into the 29th Moscow International Film Festival.\n\nLevy said he was influenced by the theory of Swiss-based psychologist Alice Miller, published in 1980, that something must have gone wrong with Hitler in his childhood. His 1995 film 'Stille Nacht' won an Honourable Mention at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nHe is one of the founders of the German company X Filme Creative Pool.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Dani Levy, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He eventually was hired as a writer for sitcoms such as The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Martin. He began to concentrate on writing and wrote his first novel, Stray Dogs, which became the basis the 1997 film U Turn, directed by Oliver Stone. Ridley also provided the original script for the film Three Kings, starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube. But his script was changed so much by director David O. Russell that he only received a credit for the original story. He also tried his hand at directing with the film Cold Around the Heart. He is one of the creators of Urban Entertainment, showcasing short films and animation from minority filmmakers, including his own works: the animated cartoons Undercover Brother (the basis for the Undercover Brother film starring comedian Eddie Griffin) and Those Who Walk in Darkness, featuring the voice of rapper Lil' Kim \u2014 which itself was the basis of a novel of the same name written by Ridley. Additionally, Ridley developed Tim Story's 2002 motion picture Barbershop into the short-lived 2005 Showtime comedy Barbershop: The Series. Ridley was the original co-host on the MSNBC daily morning show Morning Joe upon its premiere in 2007, and was an occasional guest on the network's cancelled nightly program Scarborough Country. He hosted the short-lived Movie Club with John Ridley on American Movie Classics and has written The Authority and The American Way for DC Comics. He has recently become a regular guest commentator on American Public Media's Weekend America in a segment called \"Good News, Bad News, No News\" which reviews the week's news. He co-produced the film Bobby. He wrote the play Ten Thousand Years about kamikaze pilots in World War II. On the weekend of August 19, 2006, John co-hosted the syndicated program Ebert & Roeper while film critic Roger Ebert was on medical leave. On August 28, 2007, it was announced that George Lucas hired him to pen the script for his upcoming World War II film Red Tails. Currently (December, 2009) Ridley is head writer and co-executive producer of The Wanda Sykes Show.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article John Ridley, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He graduated from Indiana University with a degree in Journalism and Comparative Literature. During the mid-nineties, he attended the MFA Film program at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts.[1] While there, he directed shorts that appeared at major festivals, including Sundance and The New York Film Festival.\n\nBilly's Hollywood Screen Kiss, featuring Sean Hayes, was O'Haver's directorial debut. The film focuses on a man, played by Hayes, who fixates on another man whose sexuality he doesn't know, played by Brad Rowe. Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss played in competition at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival. It is credited with helping Hayes win a role on the long running TV series Will and Grace. Get Over It starred Kirsten Dunst, Ben Foster, Mila Kunis and Zoe Saldana in a teen comedy about a school theater production. O'Haver's third film Ella Enchanted, features Anne Hathaway, in a modern take on the princess fairy tale. Catherine Keener, Ellen Page and James Franco star in An American Crime which premiered at Sundance in 2007. The film is based on a true story about an Indiana woman who in 1965 was charged with the murder of her neighbor's daughter. The initial reaction at Sundance was mixed, but the film went on to garner critical praise. Keener received an Emmy and Golden Globe nomination for her performance. O'Haver and his writing partner, Irene Turner, were nominated for a Writer's Guild Award for the film as well.\n\nHe is currently in pre-production on Golden Gate, a thriller for Summit Entertainment, produced by Neil Meron, Craig Zadan and Alison Rosensweig.\n\n\u200b",

He financed his own films through his production companies Boll KG and Event Film Productions. Many of his films were produced on low budgets and Boll himself had backed his projects financially or made use of crowdfunding platforms.\n\nBoll's filmmaking career is generally divided into two distinct phases: the first consists of big budget films with a usually renowned cast, most of which gained him a reputation as a \"schlock maestro\", while receiving highly negative reviews from critics, with Alone in the Dark being considered one of the worst films ever made. His second phase is marked by films with a smaller budget or were independently made, relatively unknown actors and different approaches to filmmaking; Boll's Rampage film series, Tunnel Rats, Stoic, Amoklauf, Heart of America, Assault on Wall Street and Darfur were better received by critics.\n\nBoll decided to branch out from filmmaking in 2016 to work in the restaurant industry. He opened his Bauhaus Restaurant in Vancouver, which has earned positive reviews among food critics.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Uwe Boll, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His films often feature ambitious protagonists with impossible dreams, people with unique talents in obscure fields, or individuals in conflict with nature. He is known for his unique filmmaking process, such as disregarding storyboards, emphasizing improvisation, and placing the cast and crew into similar situations as characters in his films.\n\nHerzog started work on his first film Herakles in 1961, when he was nineteen. Since then he has produced, written, and directed more than sixty feature films and documentaries, such as Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972), The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser (1974), Heart of Glass (1976), Stroszek (1977), Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979), Fitzcarraldo (1982), Cobra Verde (1987), Lessons of Darkness (1992), Little Dieter Needs to Fly (1997), My Best Fiend (1999), Invincible (2000), Grizzly Man (2005), Encounters at the End of the World (2007), Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009), and Cave of Forgotten Dreams (2010). He has published more than a dozen books of prose, and directed as many operas.\n\nFrench filmmaker Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut once called Herzog \"the most important film director alive.\" American film critic Roger Ebert said that Herzog \"has never created a single film that is compromised, shameful, made for pragmatic reasons, or uninteresting. Even his failures are spectacular.\" He was named one of the world's 100 most influential people by Time magazine in 2009.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Werner Herzog, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Stanley Kubrick (July 26, 1928 \u2013 March 7, 1999) was an American film director, writer, producer, and photographer who lived in England during most of the last four decades of his career. Kubrick was noted for the scrupulous care with which he chose his subjects, his slow method of working, the variety of genres he worked in, his technical perfectionism, and his reclusiveness about his films and personal life. He maintained almost complete artistic control, making movies according to his own whims and time constraints, but with the rare advantage of big-studio financial support for all his endeavors. Kubrick's films are characterized by a formal visual style and meticulous attention to detail\u2014his later films often have elements of surrealism and expressionism that eschews structured linear narrative. His films are repeatedly described as slow and methodical, and are often perceived as a reflection of his obsessive and perfectionist nature. A recurring theme in his films is man's inhumanity to man. While often viewed as expressing an ironic pessimism, a few critics feel his films contain a cautious optimism when viewed more carefully.\n\nThe film that first brought him attention to many critics was Paths of Glory (1957), the first of three films of his about the dehumanizing effects of war. Many of his films at first got a lukewarm reception, only to be years later acclaimed as masterpieces that had a seminal influence on many later generations of film-makers. Considered especially groundbreaking was 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) noted for being both one of the most scientifically realistic and visually innovative science-fiction films ever made while maintaining an enigmatic non-linear storyline. He voluntarily withdrew his film A Clockwork Orange (1971) from England, after it was accused of inspiring copycat crimes which in turn resulted in threats against Kubrick's family. His films were largely successful at the box-office, although Barry Lyndon (1975) performed poorly in the United States. Living authors Anthony Burgess and Stephen King were both unhappy with Kubrick's adaptations of their novels A Clockwork Orange and The Shining (1980) respectively, and both authors were engaged with subsequent adaptations. All of Kubrick's films from the mid-1950s to his death except for The Shining were nominated for Oscars, Golden Globes, or BAFTAs. Although he was nominated for an Academy Award as a screenwriter and director on several occasions, his only personal win was for the special effects in 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nEven though all of his films, apart from the first two, were adapted from novels or short stories, his works have been described by Jason Ankeny and others as \"original and visionary\". Although some critics, notably Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael, frequently disparaged Kubrick's work, Ankeny describes Kubrick as one of the most \"universally acclaimed and influential directors of the postwar era\" with a \"standing unique among the filmmakers of his day.\"",

        "biography": "Betty Thomas was born July 27, 1947 in St. Louis, Missouri, graduating from Ohio University with a BA in fine arts. Initially sidetracked, Betty first taught school in Chicago but found herself restricted and needing more of an open forum for self-expression than a classroom. She found herself drawn inextricably to comedy. After toiling as a waitress, she became part of the Second City improvisational troupe where she made use of her towering (6' 1\") imposing features in aggressive routines and sketches. True to form, she made her film debut in the sketch satire Tunnel Vision (1976) which parodied TV programming. The movie is lesser known today for its satirical bite and more for its exceptional cast of up-and-coming comedy artists at the time including Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Gerrit Graham, Howard Hesseman, and the team of Al Franken and Tom Davis. Other innocuous comedies/spoofs followed such as Chesty Anderson U.S. Navy (1976), Used Cars (1980), and Coming Attractions (1978) which, at the very least, helped to bulk up her comedy resume. She also appeared as a regular on The Fun Factory (1976), which was three parts quiz show, silly sketches, and audience participation.\n\nIronically, Betty achieved her stardom not in comedy but in hard-hitting drama. Doing a complete about face as tough-talking Officer Lucille Bates on the hit police series Hill Street Blues (1981), she displayed both grit and vulnerability as she stood nose-to-nose alongside the rest of the male-oriented precinct. She was nominated for six Emmys in all and won the \"Best Supporting Actress\" trophy in 1985. Some equally compelling mini-movie roles came along with this success. In the late 1980s, Betty made an abrupt and concentrated move into TV and film directing, one of her last acting roles being that of the butch, underhanded scoutmaster (and Shelley Long's misery-inducing nemesis) in the obvious comedy film Troop Beverly Hills (1989). Betty received her bookend Emmy award while directing the cable sitcom Dream On (1990). She never lost her taste for comedy satire, however. One of her major box office successes would come with the spot-on parody The Brady Bunch Movie (1995). She has continued in this lighter vein of late, guiding the one-man promotion machine Howard Stern to a surprisingly entertaining critical hit with Private Parts (1997), which was based on his memoirs, the Jennifer Love Hewitt film Can't Hardly Wait (1998), I Spy (2002), an updated remake of the 1960s TV series, and Surviving Christmas (2004).",

        "biography": "Roman Fran\u00e7ois Coppola (April 22, 1965) is the son of Francis Ford Coppola and an American filmmaker, screenwriter, producer, and entrepreneur. With the 2012 film Moonrise Kingdom, he and co-writer Wes Anderson were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. His television series Mozart in the Jungle won the 2016 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy. In 2019, Coppola was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nCoppola serves as president of the San Francisco-based film company American Zoetrope. He is also the founder and owner of The Directors Bureau, a commercial and music video production company.  Coppola began his directing career by overseeing in-camera visual effects and second unit direction for Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, which garnered a BAFTA Award nomination for Visual Effects. He has continued to do second unit direction throughout his career, including his father's Jack, The Rainmaker, Youth Without Youth, and Tetro; collaborator Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Darjeeling Limited; and his sister Sofia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides and Marie Antoinette.\n\nIn the 1990s, Coppola established himself as an influential music video and commercial director. Through his production company, The Directors Bureau, he directed all four music videos for The Strokes' 2001 debut album, Is This It, as well as \"12:51\" for Room on Fire. His other music videos include clips for Daft Punk, Lilys, Moby, The Presidents of the United States of America, Ween, Green Day, and Fatboy Slim. His music video for Phoenix's \"Funky Squaredance\" was invited into the permanent collection at the New York Museum of Modern Art. He has also been a supporter of cousin Jason Schwartzman's musical side project, Coconut Records.\n\nHis first feature film, CQ, premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival and was well-received critically. Set in Paris in 1969, CQ centers on a young film editor trying to juggle his personal and professional life while simultaneously juggling a science fiction adventure and his own personal art film. Coppola's second feature, A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III, debuted in 2012 at the Rome Film Festival. Charlie Sheen starred as the title character, a graphic designer dealing with a break-up. The cast also included Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman. Reviews for the film tended toward the negative.\n\nCoppola is also an inventor and entrepreneur, responsible for the Photobubble Company, Pacific Tote Company, and a number of projects through the \"Special Projects\" arm of his production company.",

        ],
        "biography": "Anne Fontaine (born in Luxembourg, 1959) is a filmmaker and screenwriter who used to be an actor. She lives and works in France.\n\nBorn Fontaine Sibertin-Blanc, sister of actor Jean-Chr\u00e9tien Sibertin-Blanc, she went as a young child to live in Lisbon, where her father, Antoine Sibertin-Blanc, is a music professor and cathedral organist. In adolescence she moved to Paris and trained in dance with Joseph Russillo while continuing her academic education, including philosophy. Her husband is Philippe Carcassonne, the film producer, and they have an adopted son who was born in Vietnam.\n\nWhile still dancing, she was picked by Robert Hossein to play Esmeralda in a 1980 theatrical production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and around this time started to use the name Anne Fontaine. She continued with acting and became known for her roles in comedies like Si ma gueule vous pla\u00eet... (1981) and P.R.O.F.S.(1985). An opportunity to be assistant director came with a 1986 stage version of C\u00e9line's Voyage au bout de la nuit (Journey to the End of the Night) at the Renaud-Barrault theatre.\n\nFontaine's first project as solo director, Les histoires d'amour finissent mal... en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (Love Affairs Usually End Badly), won the 1993 Prix Jean Vigo (prize). In 1995, she worked with her brother on the comic Augustin. Two years later, she wrote and directed the successful Nettoyage \u00e0 Sec (Dry Cleaning). This won the Best Screenplay award at the Venice Film Festival 1997 and is generally considered a milestone on Fontaine's way to becoming \"an important figure in contemporary French cinema\".\n\nIn 1999 the character Augustin (Jean-Chr\u00e9tien Sibertin-Blanc) re-appeared in Fontaine's film Augustin, Roi Du Kung-Fu (Augustin, King of Kung-Fu). Comment j'ai tu\u00e9 mon p\u00e8re (How I Killed My Father) was released in 2001, and Nathalie... followed in 2003. The 2005 film, Entre Ses Mains (In His Hands) has been widely described as a thriller: an \"intimate thriller\" according to Fontaine herself. A third Augustin film, Nouvelle chance (also known as Oh La La) was released in 2006. Then came La fille de Monaco (The Girl From Monaco) in 2008 and Coco avant Chanel (Coco Before Chanel), her biopic of Coco Chanel, in 2009.\n\nFontaine's work is not easily categorised, though the phrase \"psychological drama\" is often used. She told a UK newspaper, \"I try to work on my characters' blind side, in a kind of Freudian way: to ask, 'What are the things about themselves that they're unaware of?' I'm fascinated by the irony of fate, when something goes into a skid. All my stories have an element of cruelty in them.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Anne Fontaine (filmmaker), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Her movies are known for tackling subjects controversial or \"risky\" in Indonesia such as homosexuality, migrant workers, and polygamy.\n\nDinata began her film career directing video clips and commercials in the mid-1990s until directing the made-for-television Mencari Pelangi in 1998. Three years later, she directed her first feature film, Ca-bau-kan, after founding her own production house. The next film she directed, 2003's Arisan!, was critically acclaimed and one of her most successful works. Her third directorial effort, 2006's Berbagi Suami, was controversial yet successful.\n\nDinata has faced heavy censorship and controversy in Indonesia because of the subjects she covers. However, she has also won critical acclaim internationally, being called Indonesia's \"most talented new filmmaker\" in 2006. Two of the films she direct have been submitted to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

        "biography": "James Lawrence Brooks is an American director, producer and screenwriter. Growing up in North Bergen, New Jersey, Brooks endured a fractured family life and passed the time by reading and writing. After dropping out of New York University, he got a job as an usher at CBS, going on to write for the CBS News broadcasts. He moved to Los Angeles in 1965 to work on David L. Wolper's documentaries. After being laid off he met producer Allan Burns who secured him a job as a writer on the series My Mother the Car.\n\nBrooks wrote for several shows before being hired as a story editor on My Friend Tony and later creating the series Room 222. Grant Tinker hired Brooks and Burns at MTM Productions to create The Mary Tyler Moore Show in 1970. The show, one of the first to feature an independent working woman as its lead character, was critically acclaimed and won Brooks several Primetime Emmy Awards. Brooks and Burns then created two successful spin-offs from Mary Tyler Moore in the shape of Rhoda (a comedy) and Lou Grant (a drama). Brooks left MTM Productions in 1978 to co-create the sitcom Taxi which, despite winning multiple Emmys, suffered from low ratings and was canceled twice.\n\nHe moved into feature film work when he wrote and co-produced the 1979 film Starting Over. His next project was the critically acclaimed film Terms of Endearment, which he produced, directed and wrote, winning an Academy Award for all three positions. Basing his next film, Broadcast News, on his journalistic experiences the film earned him a further two Academy Award nominations. Although his 1994 work I'll Do Anything was hampered by negative press attention due to the cutting of all of its recorded musical numbers, As Good as It Gets (co-written with Mark Andrus) earned further praise. It was seven years until his next film, which came in the shape of 2004's Spanglish. His sixth film, How Do You Know, was released in 2010. Brooks also produced and mentored Cameron Crowe on Say Anything... (1989) and Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson on Bottle Rocket (1996).\n\nAlthough he did not intend to do so, Brooks returned to television in 1987 as the producer of The Tracey Ullman Show. He hired cartoonist Matt Groening to create a series of shorts for the show, which eventually led to The Simpsons in 1989. The Simpsons won numerous awards and is still running after 20 years. Brooks also co-produced and co-wrote the 2007 film adaptation of the show, The Simpsons Movie. In total, Brooks has received 47 Emmy nominations, winning 20 of them.",

Allen's distinctive films, which run the gamut from dramas to screwball sex comedies, have made him a notable American director. He is also distinguished by his rapid rate of production and his very large body of work. Allen writes and directs his movies and has also acted in the majority of them. For inspiration, Allen draws heavily on literature, sexuality, philosophy, psychology, Jewish identity, and the history of cinema, among a wealth of other fields of interest. Allen developed a passion for music early on and is a celebrated jazz clarinetist. What began as a teenage avocation has led to regular public performances at various small venues in his hometown of Manhattan, with occasional appearances at various jazz festivals. Allen joined the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and the New Orleans Funeral Ragtime Orchestra in performances that provided the film score for his 1973 comedy Sleeper, and performed in a rare European tour in 1996, which became the subject of the documentary Wild Man Blues.",

His films span four decades with themes examining the personalities of well-known musicians, dysfunctional and dystopian societies, and blurred gender roles.\n\nHaynes first gained public attention with his controversial short film Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story (1987), which chronicles singer Karen Carpenter's life and death, using Barbie dolls as actors. Superstar became a cult classic. Haynes's feature directorial debut, Poison (1991), a provocative exploration of AIDS-era queer perceptions and subversions, established him as a figure of a new transgressive cinema. Poison won the Sundance Film Festival's Grand Jury Prize and is regarded as a seminal work of New Queer Cinema.\n\nHaynes received further acclaim for his second feature film, Safe (1995), a symbolic portrait of a housewife who develops multiple chemical sensitivity. Safe was later voted the best film of the 1990s by The Village Voice Film Poll. His next feature, Velvet Goldmine (1998), is a tribute to the 1970s glam rock era. The film received the Special Jury Prize for Best Artistic Contribution at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nHaynes gained acclaim and a measure of mainstream success with Far from Heaven (2002) earning his first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. He continued to direct critically lauded films such as I'm Not There (2007), Carol (2015), Wonderstruck (2017) and Dark Waters (2019). He directed his first feature-length documentary, The Velvet Underground (2021). Haynes directed and co-wrote the HBO mini-series Mildred Pierce (2011) for which he was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards.",

He was also among the postwar writer-directors who made some of their best films as they struggled to break free of industry censorship. His legacy is that of a filmmaker who sought independence in a collaborative art and tried to bring his own vision to the screen.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Richard Brooks, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His second feature film did not come until 1991's Lonely Hearts.\n\nHis first breakout project was the televised documentary The Lost Fleet of Guadalcanal, which he produced for the National Geographic Society and which aired in 1993 on PBS. The following year, he directed and produced Russia's Last Tsar for National Geographic and PBS. He also directed and produced America's Endangered Species: Don't Say Good-bye in 1996. The International Documentary Association presented the picture with the Strand Award for Best Documentary.\n\nKenner began a long association with the award-winning PBS documentary television program American Experience in 1998. That year he directed and produced the widely reviewed Influenza, 1918 (about the 1918 flu pandemic)and followed it up with John Brown's Holy War (about abolitionist John Brown) in 2001. His first documentary which he wrote, directed and produced was War Letters, which aired on American Experience in 2001. The documentary is based on the 2001 New York Times best-selling book War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars by historian Andrew Carroll. He produced the episode, \"The Road to Memphis,\" for the 2003 PBS documentary series, The Blues, and in 2005 produced and directed the Vietnam War documentary, Two Days in October. The documentary was the season premiere of American Experience. The film, which is based on David Maraniss' book They Marched into Sunlight, looks at the parallels between a Viet Cong ambush of a U.S. Army patrol (and the subsequent cover-up of the loss by the American military) and a violent clash between police and student protesters at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\u2014events which occurred 24 hours apart in October 1967. The episode was nominated for and won the award for Exceptional Merit in Nonfiction Filmmaking at the 2006 Emmy Awards.\n\nIn 2008, Kenner produced and directed the documentary film, Food, Inc., which examines large-scale agricultural food production in the United States, concluding that the meat and vegetables produced by this type of economic enterprise leads to inexpensive but environmentally harmful and unhealthy food.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Robert Kenner, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u200b",

He then transitioned into television as a director and co-creator of the drama series Felicity (1998\u20132002) alongside J.J. Abrams. Reeves has since directed the horror film Cloverfield (2008), the romantic horror film Let Me In (2010), and the science fiction sequels Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) and War for the Planet of the Apes (2017).

        "biography": "Stuart Rosenberg  was an American film and television director whose notable works included the movies Cool Hand Luke (1967), Voyage of the Damned (1976), The Amityville Horror (1979), and The Pope of Greenwich Village (1984). He was noted for his work with actor Paul Newman.\n\nRosenberg was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Sara (n\u00e9e Kaminsky) and David Rosenberg. He studied Irish literature at New York University in Manhattan, and began working as an apprentice film editor while in graduate school.\n\nAfter advancing to film editor, he then transitioned into directing with episodes of the syndicated TV series Decoy (1957\u201359). It was the first police series on American television built around a female protagonist. Over the next two years, Rosenberg directed 15 episodes of the ABC police-detective series Naked City, also shot in New York City. Fifteen episodes of The Untouchables followed, eight of the anthology series Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, five of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and three of The Twilight Zone, along with episodes of Adventures in Paradise, The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Ben Casey, Rawhide with Clint Eastwood, and Falk's The Trials of O'Brien, among other shows. He won a 1963 Emmy Award for directing \"The Madman\", one of his 19 episodes of the courtroom drama The Defenders.\n\nFollowing the Lutheran-financed U.S.-German co-production Question 7 (1961), filmed in West Berlin, Germany, Rosenberg shot the 1965 TV-movie, Memorandum for a Spy and the 1966 telefilm Fame Is the Name of the Game before making his major-studio debut with the Paul Newman hit Cool Hand Luke (1967). Rosenberg had come across Donn Pearce's chain gang novel and developed the film with actor Jack Lemmon's production company, Jalem. Years later, Rosenberg would replace Bob Rafelson on another prison movie, Brubaker (1980) starring Robert Redford.\n\nOther Rosenberg films include The April Fools (1969), with French actress Catherine Deneuve in her American debut opposite Jack Lemmon; the Newman movies WUSA (1970), Pocket Money (1972) and The Drowning Pool (1975); the Walter Matthau police-detective thriller The Laughing Policeman (1973); the Charles Bronson action picture Love and Bullets (1979); and another action movie Let's Get Harry (1986), for which Rosenberg used the Directors Guild of America pseudonym Alan Smithee. He was famous for straight dramas and, especially, crime films. The most acclaimed movie he did after 'Cool Hand Luke' was The Pope of Greenwich Village with Eric Roberts, Mickey Rourke, and Daryl Hannah.\n\nHe made his last film, the independent drama My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys, in 1991.\n\nIn 1993, Rosenberg became a teacher at the American Film Institute. Among his students were those who would go on to make names for themselves: Todd Field, Darren Aronofsky, Mark Waters, Scott Silver, Doug Ellin and Rob Schmidt.\n\nRosenberg died in 2007 of a heart attack at his home in Beverly Hills, California. He was survived by his wife, Margot Pohoryles, whom he had met at NYU; son Benjamin Rosenberg, a first assistant director; as well as four grandchildren.\n\nHis students' films The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Alphabet Killer, and The Wrestler that were released in 2008 were dedicated in memory of him.",

He first became widely known for writing the screenplay of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976). He later continued his collaboration with Scorsese, writing or co-writing Raging Bull (1980), The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), and Bringing Out the Dead (1999). Schrader has also directed 24 films, including Blue Collar (1978), Hardcore (1979), American Gigolo (1980), Cat People (1982), Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters (1985), Light Sleeper (1992), Affliction (1997), and First Reformed (2017); the latter earned him his first Academy Award nomination. Schrader's work frequently depicts troubled men struggling through an existential crisis that is then punctuated by a violent, cathartic event.\n\nRaised in a strict Calvinist family, Schrader attended Calvin College before electing to pursue film studies at UCLA on the encouragement of film critic Pauline Kael. He then worked as a film scholar and critic, publishing the book Transcendental Style in Film: Ozu, Bresson, Dreyer (1972) before making the transition to screenwriting in 1974. The success of Taxi Driver in 1976 brought greater attention to his work, and Schrader began directing his own films beginning with Blue Collar (co-written with his brother, Leonard Schrader). His three most recent films have been described by Schrader as a loose trilogy: First Reformed (2017), The Card Counter (2021), and Master Gardener (2022).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Paul Schrader, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Levin was awarded the 1997 DuPont-Columbia Award for CIA: America's Secret Warriors, a three-part series that first aired on the Discovery Channel. He is also the recipient of a 1999 primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Non-Fiction Special. In 1996, his Prisoners of the War on Drugs was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Informational Special. He was also nominated for an Emmy, in 2010, for his role as producer of the documentary series Brick City.\n\nLevin's documentary The Protocols of Zion, which is about resurgent anti-Semitism following the September 11, 2001 attacks, focuses on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an anti-Semitic forgery which supposedly describes the Jewish plan for global domination. Although the book has been repeatedly debunked as an obvious forgery, Levin continually discovers various groups presenting it as \"proof\" for their own anti-Semitic agenda.\n\nHe graduated from Wesleyan University in 1973.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Marc Levin, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He attended King Edward VI Grammar School and at the age of 19 went to serve in the Royal Air Force. He read law at St Peter's College, Oxford and graduated with a third-class degree. As a member of the Oxford University Experimental Theatre Club he directed an open-air production of Bartholomew Fair for the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford, in 1959 (when he also took the role of the shady horse-dealer Dan Jordan Knockem). After Oxford, he began a career in the dramatic arts.\n\nLoach's film Kes (1969) was voted the seventh greatest British film of the 20th century in a poll by the British Film Institute. Two of his films, The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006) and I, Daniel Blake (2016), received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, making him one of only nine filmmakers to win the award twice.",

        "biography": "Celebrated American documentarian who gradually amassed a considerable reputation and a devoted audience with a series of reassuringly traditional meditations on Americana. Burns' works are treasure troves of archival materials; he skillfully utilizes period music and footage, photographs, periodicals and ordinary people's correspondence, the latter often movingly read by seasoned professional actors in a deliberate attempt to get away from a \"Great Man\" approach to history. Like most non-fiction filmmakers, Burns wears many hats on his projects, often serving as writer, cinematographer, editor and music director in addition to producing and directing. He achieved his apotheosis with The Civil War (1990), a phenomenally popular 11-hour documentary that won two Emmys and broke all previous ratings records for public TV. The series' companion coffee table book--priced at a hefty $50--sold more than 700,000 copies. The audio version, narrated by Burns, was also a major best-seller. In the final accounting, \"The Civil War\" became the first documentary to gross over $100 million. Not surprisingly, it has become perennial fund-raising programming for public TV stations around the country. Burns arrived upon the scene with the Oscar-nominated Brooklyn Bridge (1981), a nostalgic chronicle of the construction of the fabled edifice. The film was more widely seen when rebroadcast on PBS the following year. Though Burns has made other nonfiction films for theatrical release, notably an acclaimed and ambiguous portrait of Depression-era Louisiana governor Huey Long (1985), PBS would prove to be his true home. He cast a probing eye on such American subjects as The Statue of Liberty (1985), The Congress (1988) (PBS), painter Thomas Hart Benton (1988) (PBS) and early radio with Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio (1991) (PBS). Burns returned to long-form documentary with his most ambitious project to date, an 18-hour history of Baseball (1994), which aired on PBS in the fall of 1994. He approached the national pastime as a template for understanding changes in modern American society. Ironically, this was the only baseball on the air at the time, as the players and owners were embroiled in a bitter strike.",

He wrote the screenplays for most of the 37 feature films he directed, many of which are today considered classics: The Maltese Falcon (1941), The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), The Asphalt Jungle (1950), The African Queen (1951), The Misfits (1961), Fat City (1972), The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and Prizzi's Honor (1985).\n\nIn his early years, Huston studied and worked as a fine art painter in Paris. He explored the visual aspects of his films throughout his career, sketching each scene on paper beforehand, then carefully framing his characters during the shooting. While most directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work, Huston instead created his films while they were being shot, with little editing needed. Some of Huston's films were adaptations of important novels, often depicting an \"heroic quest,\" as in Moby Dick, or The Red Badge of Courage. In many films, different groups of people, while struggling toward a common goal, would become doomed, forming \"destructive alliances,\" giving the films a dramatic and visual tension. Many of his films involved themes such as religion, meaning, truth, freedom, psychology, colonialism, and war.\n\nHuston has been referred to as \"a titan\", \"a rebel\", and a \"renaissance man\" in the Hollywood film industry. Author Ian Freer describes him as \"cinema's Ernest Hemingway\"\u2014a filmmaker who was \"never afraid to tackle tough issues head on.\" During his 46-year career, Huston received 15 Oscar nominations, winning twice. He directed both his father, Walter Huston, and daughter, Anjelica Huston, to Oscar wins.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article John Huston, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In 1995, he directed a short film, The Hard Case, followed by the crime comedy, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), his feature-length directorial debut. He soon gained recognition with his second film, Snatch (2000), which also found critical and commercial success. Following Snatch, Ritchie directed Swept Away (2002), a critically panned box-office bomb starring Madonna, to whom Ritchie was married between 2000 and 2008. He went on to direct Revolver (2005) and RocknRolla (2008), which were less successful and received mixed audience reviews. In 2009 and 2011, he directed two box-office hits, Sherlock Holmes and its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, respectively. The former was nominated for Academy Awards in Best Original Score and Best Art Direction.\n\nHis other directed motion pictures are The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015), which is a remake of a 1960 spy series, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) and the live-action adaptation of Disney's Aladdin (2019). Aladdin earned more than $1 billion worldwide, becoming one of the highest-grossing films in 2019, and the 34th highest-grossing film of all-time during its theatrical run. In 2020, he returned to crime comedy with The Gentlemen (2019), which was mostly well received and a commercial success. In 2021, he directed Jason Statham in the action film, Wrath of Man.",

He moves easily between the buttoned-down demeanor that suits a police procedural story and the loose-jointed manner of his comic roles.\" A repeated theme in roles he has portrayed is that of saving the world, including the characters of Ted Logan, Buddha, Neo, Johnny Mnemonic, John Constantine and Klaatu.",

He is closely associated with the Dogme 95 collective, although his own films have taken a variety of different approaches. He is known for his female-centric parables and his exploration of controversial subject matter.\n\nVon Trier began making his own films at the age of 11 after receiving a Super-8 camera as a gift, and his first publicly released film was an experimental short called The Orchid Gardener, in 1977. His first feature film came seven years later, The Element of Crime, in 1984. As of 2010, he has directed a further 10 feature films, 5 short films and 4 television productions.\n\nHe has been married twice and is currently married to Bente Fr\u00f8ge. Von Trier suffers periodically from depression, as well as various fears and phobias, including an intense fear of flying. As he himself once put it, \"Basically, I'm afraid of everything in life, except filmmaking\".",

His 1996 book Tout contre L\u00e9o (Close to Leo) talks about HIV and is aimed at young adults; he made it into a movie in 2002. He wrote other books for young adults throughout the late 1990s. His first play, Les D\u00e9butantes, was performed at Avignon's Off Festival in 1998. In 2005, he returns to Avignon to present his latest creation, Dionysos impuissant, in the \"In\" Festival; Joana Preiss and Louis Garrel, who has acted in a number of Honor\u00e9 films, played the leads.\n\nA well-known director, he is considered an \"auteur\" in French Cinema. His 2006 film \"Dans Paris\" has led him to be considered by French critics as the heir to the Nouvelle Vague Cinema. In 2007, Les Chansons d'amour was one of the films selected to be in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Some of his movies or screenplays (like Les filles ne savent pas nager, Dix-sept fois C\u00e9cile Cassard and Les Chansons d'amour) deal with gay or lesbian relations.\n\nHonor\u00e9 has been the screenwriter for some of Ga\u00ebl Morel's films.

        "also_known_as": [],
        "biography": "John Frederick Milius is an American screenwriter, director, and producer of motion pictures. He was one of the writers for the first two Dirty Harry films, received an Academy Award nomination as screenwriter of Apocalypse Now, and wrote and directed The Wind and the Lion, Conan the Barbarian and Red Dawn.\n\nHe wrote a number of iconic film lines such as \"Charlie don't surf\" and \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning,\" from Apocalypse Now, and the famous Dirty Harry one-liners delivered by Clint Eastwood, including \"Go ahead, make my day\" and \"Ask yourself one question, 'do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk?\". Milius also wrote the USS Indianapolis monologue in the film Jaws; the sequence performed by Robert Shaw.  After his work on Rough Riders (1997), Milius became an instrumental force in lobbying Congress to award President Theodore Roosevelt the Medal of Honor (posthumously), for acts of conspicuous gallantry while in combat on San Juan Hill. Milius made two films featuring Roosevelt: The Wind and the Lion (where he was played by Brian Keith) and the made-for-TV film Rough Riders (where Tom Berenger took the role).\n\nThe character of John Milner from the 1973 George Lucas film American Graffiti was inspired by Milius, who was a good friend of Lucas while they were at USC film school. Likewise, the character Walter Sobchak in the 1998 film The Big Lebowski, made by his friends the Coen Brothers, was partly based on Milius. The novella \"Blind Jozef Pronek and Dead Souls\" by Aleksandar Hemon features an episode with Milius, who is described as \"sitting at a desk sucking on a cigar as long as a walking stick.\"\n\nIn 2013 a documentary about his life, titled Milius, was released.\n\nWriter Nat Segaloff called Milius:\n\n\"The best writer of the so-called USC Mafia, a tight-knit group that resuscitated\u2014some say homogenised American cinema in the 1970s... Raised on Ford, Hawks, Lean and Kurosawa, shaped by filmmakers as disparate as Fellini and Delmer Daves, Milius favours history books over comic books, character over special effects, and heroes with roots in reality, time, place and customs. Milius' stories reflect his own deeply held ethic, which embraces the values of tradition, adventure, spiritualism, honour and an intense loyalty to friends...  Although he privately chafes at his public image as a gun-toting, liberal baiting provocateur, he allows himself to be painted as such, at times even holding the brush. He plays the Hollywood game like a pro, yet sticks to his own rules; he is a romantic filmmaker who avoids love scenes; his movies contain violence, yet no death in them is without meaning.\"\n\nMilius himself once said:\n\n\"Never compromise excellence. To write for someone else is the biggest mistake that any writer makes. You should be your biggest competitor, your biggest critic, your biggest fan, because you don\u2019t know what anybody else thinks. How arrogant it is to assume that you know the market, that you know what\u2019s popular today [...] Write what you want to see. Because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not going to have any true passion in it, and it\u2019s not going to be done with any true artistry.\"",

        "biography": "Sylvester Stallone (born Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone, July 6, 1946) is an American actor and filmmaker. After his beginnings as a struggling actor for a number of years upon arriving to New York City in 1969 and later Hollywood in 1974, he won his first critical acclaim as an actor for his co-starring role as Stanley Rosiello in The Lords of Flatbush.\n\nHe subsequently found gradual work as an extra or side character in films with a sizable budget until he achieved his greatest critical and commercial success as an actor and screenwriter, starting in 1976 with his role as boxer Rocky Balboa, in the first film of the successful Rocky series (1976\u2013present), for which he also wrote the screenplays. In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog boxer who fights numerous brutal opponents, and wins the world heavyweight championship twice.\n\nIn 1977, he was the third actor in cinema to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. His film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry, and had its props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. His use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps. Philadelphia has a statue of his Rocky placed permanently near the museum, and he was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nUp until 1982, his films were not big box office successes unless they were Rocky sequels, and none received the critical acclaim achieved with the first Rocky. This changed with the successful action film First Blood in which he portrayed the PTSD-plagued soldier John Rambo. Originally an adaptation of the eponymous novel by David Morell, First Blood\u2019s script was significantly altered by Stallone during the film\u2019s production. He would play the role in a total of five Rambo films (1982\u20132019). From the mid-1980s through to the late 1990s, he would go on to become one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors of that era by appearing in a slew of commercially successful action films which were however generally panned by critics. These include Cobra, Tango and Cash, Cliffhanger, the better received Demolition Man, and The Specialist.\n\nHe declined in popularity in the early 2000s but rebounded back to prominence in 2006 with a sixth installment in the Rocky series and 2008 with a fourth in the Rambo series. In the 2010s, he launched The Expendables films series (2010\u20132014), in which he played the lead as the mercenary Barney Ross. In 2013, he starred in the successful Escape Plan, and acted in its sequels. In 2015, he returned to the Rocky series with Creed, that serve as spin-off films focusing on Adonis \"Donnie\" Creed played by Michael B. Jordan, the son of the ill-fated boxer Apollo Creed, to whom the long-retired Rocky is a mentor. Reprising the role brought him praise, and his first Golden Globe award for the first Creed, as well as a third Oscar nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior.",

        "biography": "Roman Pola\u0144ski (born 18 August 1933) is a Polish-French film director, producer, writer and actor. Born in Paris to Polish parents, Pola\u0144ski relocated with his family to Poland in 1937. After surviving the Holocaust, he continued his education in Poland and became a critically acclaimed director of both art house and commercial films. Pola\u0144ski's first feature-length film, Knife in the Water (1962), made in Poland, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. He has since received five more Oscar nominations, and in 2002 received the Academy Award for Best Director for his film, The Pianist. He has also been the recipient of two Baftas, four C\u00e9sars, a Golden Globe and the Palme d'Or. He left Poland in 1961 to live in France for several years, then moved to the United Kingdom where he collaborated with G\u00e9rard Brach on three films, beginning with Repulsion (1965). In 1968 he moved to the United States, immediately cementing his burgeoning directing status with the 1968 groundbreaking Academy Award winning horror film Rosemary's Baby.\n\nIn 1969, Pola\u0144ski's pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered while staying at the Pola\u0144ski's Benedict Canyon home above Los Angeles by members of the Manson Family. Following Tate's death, Pola\u0144ski returned to Europe and spent much of his time in Paris and Gstaad, but did not make another film until he filmed Macbeth (1971) in England. The following year he went to Italy to make What? (1973) and subsequently spent the next five years living near Rome. However, he traveled to Hollywood to direct Chinatown (1974) for Paramount Pictures, with Robert Evans serving as producer. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, and was a critical and box-office success; the script by Robert Towne won for Best Original Screenplay. Pola\u0144ski's next film, The Tenant (1976), was shot in France, and completed the \"Apartment Trilogy\", following Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.\n\nIn 1977, after a photo shoot in Los Angeles, Pola\u0144ski was arrested for the sexual abuse of a 13 year old girl. He was charged with rape but pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor. To avoid sentencing, Pola\u0144ski fled to his home in London, and then moved on to France the following day. He has had a U.S. arrest warrant outstanding since then, and an international arrest warrant since 2005.\n\nPola\u0144ski continued to make films such as The Pianist (2002), a World War II-set adaptation of Jewish-Polish musician W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman's autobiography of the same name, which echoed some of Pola\u0144ski's earlier life experiences. Like Szpilman, Pola\u0144ski escaped the ghetto and the concentration camps while family members were killed. The film won three Academy Awards including Best Director, the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or, and seven French C\u00e9sar Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. He then released the successful films Oliver Twist (2005), To Each His Own Cinema (2007), and The Ghost Writer (2010), completed while under house arrest.\n\nIn September 2009, Pola\u0144ski was arrested by Swiss police, at the request of U.S. authorities, when he traveled to receive a lifetime achievement award at the Zurich Film Festival. In October 2009, the U.S. requested his extradition; however, on July 12, 2010, the Swiss rejected that request and instead declared him a \"free man\" after releasing him from custody.",

He is known for his fast-paced and kinetic, satirical genre films, which feature extensive utilisation of expressive popular music, Steadicam tracking shots, dolly zooms and a signature editing style that includes transitions, whip pans and wipes. He began making independent short films before making his first feature film A Fistful of Fingers in 1995. Wright created and directed the comedy series Asylum in 1996, written with David Walliams. After directing several other television shows, Wright directed the sitcom Spaced (1999\u20132001), which aired for two seasons and starred frequent collaborators Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.\n\nIn 2004, Wright directed the zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead, starring Pegg and Frost, the first film in Wright's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy. The film was co-written with Pegg \u2014 as were the next two entries in the trilogy, the buddy cop film Hot Fuzz (2007) and the science fiction comedy The World's End (2013). In 2010, Wright co-wrote and directed the action comedy film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, an adaptation of the graphic novel series. Along with Joe Cornish and Steven Moffat, he adapted The Adventures of Tintin (2011) for Steven Spielberg.

(2001). Following the trilogy, projects included Australia (2008), The Great Gatsby (2013), Elvis (2022), and his television period drama The Get Down (2016) for Netflix. Additional projects include stage productions of Giacomo Puccini's La boh\u00e8me for both the Australian Opera and Broadway and Strictly Ballroom the Musical (2014).\n\nLuhrmann is equally known for his Grammy-nominated soundtracks for Moulin Rouge! and The Great Gatsby, as well as his record label House of Iona, a co-venture with RCA Records. Serving as producer on all of his musical soundtracks, he also holds writing credits on many of the individual tracks. His album Something for Everybody features music from many of his films and also includes his hit \"Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)\".",

His four Academy Awards for Best Director (1935, 1940, 1941, 1952) is a record, and one of those films, How Green Was My Valley (1941), also won Best Picture.\n\nIn a career that spanned more than 50 years, Ford directed more than 140 films (although nearly all of his silent films are now lost) and he is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers of his generation. Ford's films and personality were held in high regard by his colleagues, with Ingmar Bergman and Orson Welles among those who have named him as one of the greatest directors of all time.\n\nIn particular, Ford was a pioneer of location shooting and the long shot which frames his characters against a vast, harsh and rugged natural terrain.",

        "biography": "James Richard Kelly (born 1975) is an American writer-director, best known for his debut feature, the science-fiction cult classic \"Donnie Darko\"(2001).\n\nKelly was born in Newport News, Virginia, the son of Lane and Ennis Kelly. He won a scholarship to the University of Southern California to study at the USC School of Cinema-Television. He made two short films at USC, \"The Goodbye Place\" and \"Visceral Matter\", before graduating in 1997.\n\n\"Donnie Darko\" was his first feature and was nominated for 21 awards, winning 11 of them, including a nomination for a Saturn Award. The film later ended up #2 on Empire magazine's list of 50 greatest independent films of all time, behind Quentin Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\".\n\nKelly wrote the screenplay for Tony Scott's biographical crime thriller \"Domino\" (2005), and went on to write and direct the postmodern L.A. satire \"Southland Tales\" (2006) and the science-fiction mystery \"The Box\" (2009), inspired by \"The Twilight Zone\" episode \"Button, Button\". Although his three films differ considerably in setting and characters, they share similar themes of time travel, existentialism, and spirituality.\n\nKelly's particular filmmaking sensibilities can be traced back to his viewing of Terry Giliam's \"Brazil\" (1985), as told to author Robert K. Elder in an interview for his book \"The Film That Changed My Life\" (2011).\n\nThe commercial underperformance of Kelly's films has made it difficult for him to secure financing for other projects, and as such he has not directed a film since 2009. In 2016, filmmaker Kevin Smith said of Kelly: \"He is insanely creative and is not unlike Christopher Nolan. But Nolan wound up in the Warner Bros. system where he got special handling, and he got a lot of money to make huge art films like \"Inception\". Richard can be one of our greatest filmmakers. He is right now, but just a lot of people don't realize it. He's still a kid, and someone needs to Nolan that kid.\"",

He was late entering the film industry. Aged 27 he was drawing cartoons at art college before becoming involved in drama when he began studying film at Leeds Polytechnic, now the Metropolitan University of Leeds. He then trained as an animator at the National Film School in London.\n\nHe moved away from animation and continued to study directing. He also wrote lyrics for The Christians.\n\nHerman\u2019s first feature-length project was Blame It on the Bellboy (1992), a comedy of mistaken identity starring Dudley Moore and Bryan Brown.\n\nNext, Herman wrote and directed the critically acclaimed Brassed Off (1996), following the members of a colliery brass band, still struggling to survive a decade after the miners' strike.\n\nIn Little Voice (1998), adapted by Herman from Jim Cartwright's play The Rise and Fall of Little Voice, Jane Horrocks reprises the title role of a harried young woman whose only escape lies in the memory of her father and in imitating the singers he admired. This film gave Michael Caine the opportunity for his best performance to date.\n\nPurely Belter (2000), adapted by Herman from Jonathan Tulloch's novel The Season Ticket, is the story of two teenage boys trying to get together enough money for a couple of Newcastle United F.C. season tickets.\n\nHope Springs (2003), is an adaptation of New Cardiff.\n\nHis most recent work is the adaptation of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. It was produced by David Heyman and stars David Thewlis, Vera Farmiga, Sheila Hancock and Rupert Friend. Herman directed and adapted the work.\n\nMark Herman is a fellow of Film and Television Production, York St John University, York, England.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Mark Herman, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "William Friedkin (August 29, 1935 - August 7, 2023) was an American film director, producer and screenwriter best known for directing \"The French Connection\" (1971) and \"The Exorcist\" (1973); for the former, he won the Academy Award for Best Director. Some of his other notable films include \"The Boys in the Band\" (1970), \"Sorcerer\" (1977), \"Cruising\" (1980), \"To Live and Die in L.A.\" (1985), \"Blue Chips\" (1994), \"Jade\" (1995), \"Rules of Engagement\" (2000), \"The Hunted\" (2003), \"Bug\" (2006), and \"Killer Joe\" (2011).\n\nIn 1965, Friedkin moved to Hollywood and two years later released his first feature film, \"Good Times,\" starring Sonny and Cher. Several other \"art\" films followed, including the adaptation of Mart Crowley's \"The Boys in the Band\" and most notably \"The Birthday Party,\" based on an unpublished screenplay by Harold Pinter, which he adapted from his own play. Friedkin, however, did not want to be known as an art house director, but rather for action and serious drama through stories about an America upended by crime, hypocrisy, the occult, and amorality. All of which he mounted up into his films to reflect what was going on in an America that was changing in the wake of Vietnam, the Sexual Revolution, and Watergate.\n\nIn 1971, his \"The French Connection\" was released to wide critical acclaim. Shot in a gritty style more suited for documentaries than Hollywood features, the film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Friedkin followed up with 1973's \"The Exorcist,\" based on William Peter Blatty's best-selling novel, which revolutionized the horror genre and is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. \"The Exorcist\" was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. It won the Best Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing.\n\nFollowing these two pictures, Friedkin, along with Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Bogdanovich, was deemed one of the premier directors of New Hollywood. In 1973, the trio announced the formation of an independent production company at Paramount, The Directors Company. Whereas Coppola directed \"The Conversation\" and Bogdanovich the Henry James adaptation, \"Daisy Miller,\" Friedkin abruptly left the company, which was soon closed by Paramount.  Friedkin's later movies did not achieve the same success. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Friedkin's films received mostly lackluster reviews and moderate ticket sales. However, his action/crime movie \"To Live and Die in L.A.\" (1985), starring William Petersen and Willem Dafoe, was a critical favorite and drew comparisons to Friedkin's own \"The French Connection\" (particularly for its car-chase sequence). In 2011, Friedkin directed \"Killer Joe,\" a black comedy written by Tracy Letts, and starring Matthew McConaughey.

        "biography": "Robert Aldrich was an American film director, writer and producer, notable for such films as Kiss Me Deadly (1955), The Big Knife (1955), What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), The Dirty Dozen (1967).\n\nBorn in Cranston, Rhode Island, the son of Lora Lawson and newspaper publisher Edward Burgess Aldrich. He was a grandson of U.S. Senator Nelson W. Aldrich and a cousin of Nelson Rockefeller. He studied economics at the University of Virginia.  In 1941, he dropped out of college for a $50-a-week job at RKO Radio Pictures. In doing so, he was also dropped by his family, losing a potential stake in Chase Bank he would have inherited. It's been said that \"No American film director was born as wealthy as Aldrich\u2014and then so thoroughly cut off from family money.\"\n\nHe quickly rose in film production as an assistant director, and worked with Jean Renoir, Abraham Polonsky, Robert Rossen, Joseph Losey and Charlie Chaplin as an assistant on Limelight. He became a television director in the 1950s, directing his first feature film, Big Leaguer, in 1953. During the 1950s, Aldrich directed mostly action films like Apache and Vera Cruz with Burt Lancaster.  Aldrich soon gained recognition as an auteur filmmaker, depicting his liberal humanist thematic vision in many genres, in films such as Kiss Me Deadly (1955), a film noir classic, The Big Knife (1955), an adaptation of Clifford Odets's play about Hollywood business, and Attack (1956), a WWII infantry combat film exploring how U.S. Army careerism determined who attacked and who ordered the attack.\n\nIn the 1960s, he directed several commercially successful films, such as the gothic horror stories What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as spiteful sisters and faded child-actresses, Hush\u2026 Hush, Sweet Charlotte, with Bette Davis as a Southern woman who lives in a mansion and thinks she is going insane (both Joan Crawford and Davis were to appear, but Crawford left the film); the controversial The Killing of Sister George (1968); and the hugely popular war film The Dirty Dozen (1967).\n\nThe success of The Dirty Dozen allowed him to establish his own production studio for some time, but several failures forced his return to conventionally commercial Hollywood films. Nevertheless, his humanism is evident in The Longest Yard (1974), about the rigged-game politics, and Ulzana's Raid (1972) an uncompromising film based on the real life break-out from an Indian reservation of a band led by chief Ulzana, the extreme violence and torture they exacted upon isolated pioneer families in the Arizona territory, and their pursuit by the US cavalry.\n\nFrom his marriage to Harriet Foster (1941\u201365), Robert Aldrich had four children, all of whom work in the film business: Adell, William, Alida and Kelly.  Aldrich died of kidney failure on December 5, 1983 in a Los Angeles hospital.  Film critic John Patterson summarized his career in 2012: \"He was a punchy, caustic, macho and pessimistic director, who depicted corruption and evil unflinchingly, and pushed limits on violence throughout his career. His aggressive and pugnacious film-making style, often crass and crude, but never less than utterly vital and alive, warrants \u2013 and will richly reward \u2013 your immediate attention.\"",

He is widely acclaimed as one of Hollywood's most celebrated and influential film directors. He epitomized the group of filmmakers known as the New Hollywood, which included George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, Woody Allen and William Friedkin, who emerged in the early 1970s with unconventional ideas that challenged contemporary filmmaking.\n\nHe co-authored the script for Patton, winning the Academy Award in 1970. His directorial fame escalated with the release of The Godfather in 1972. The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre, garnering universal laurels from critics and public alike. It went on to win three Academy Awards, including his second, which he won for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was instrumental in cementing his position as one of the prominent American film directors. Coppola followed it with an equally successful sequel The Godfather Part II, which became the first ever sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film received yet higher praises than its predecessor, and gave him three Academy Awards\u2014for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture. In the same year was released The Conversation, which he directed, produced and wrote. The film went on to win the Palme d'Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. His next directorial venture was Apocalypse Now in 1979, and it was as notorious for its lengthy and troubled production as it was critically acclaimed for its vivid and stark depiction of the Vietnam War. It won his second Palme d'Or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nAlthough some of Coppola's ventures in the 1980s and early 1990s were critically lauded, Coppola's later work has not met the same level of critical and commercial success as his '70s films.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Francis Ford Coppola, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nKristian Levring is a Danish director born in 1957 in Denmark. He was the fourth signatory of Dogme95. He lived eight years in France. He graduated in editing at the National Film School of Denmark and has edited a large number of documentaries and feature films besides directing two feature films, among these, Et skud fra hjertet (1986). He is the recipient of some 23 Danish and international awards for his commercials. The King is Alive (Dogme 4) is his third feature film. The King is Alive tells the story of a mixed group of tourists in Namibia, Africa, whose bus breaks down in a remote, abandoned village (formerly a mining town). Facing starvation, dehydration, cabin fever, and death, one of the group decides to stage a production of Shakespeare's King Lear and casts the others as characters. As the thin veneer of civilized behavior breaks down, the group experiences the absurdity of putting on a play (for no audience except one lone indigenous man) in such dire and fatal circumstances. Filmed in stark digital and adhering to the tenets of Dogme filmmaking, The King is Alive is a fascinating study in the dark heart of people under extreme stress. Herzogian in its theme and mood, the film's location (remote Namibia) is as much a character in the film as the actors, like the space ship in Ridley Scott's Alien. The King is Alive features Jennifer Jason-Leigh and Brion James (Blade Runner's \"Leon\"; Cabin Boy). Dark, tense, and desperate, it stands as a powerful piece of filmmaking. Levring's next film after The King is Alive is called The Intended and features some of the same actors from the former. Set in the jungle of Borneo in the 1920s, it concerns an isolated English settlement/ivory trading station. Similar in nature to The King is Alive, it focuses on what happens to small isolated groups under both internal psychological pressure and external pressure from the environment around them. As The King is Alive was filmed by Dogme rules and restrictions, The Intended instead has steady camera shots (rather than shaky/handheld) and ambient music throughout. Subtle yet powerful, the film explores Conradian contexts through the lens of a female perspective. Its influence can be seen in the Australian frontier film The Proposition.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kristian Levring, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He made his feature directorial debut with the sci-fi drama \"Love\" (2011), and went on to direct the sci-fi mystery \"The Signal\" (2014), the disaster thriller film \"Underwater\" (2020) and the supernatural horror film \"Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin\" (2021), a reboot of the long-running series.\n\nLike filmmakers Steven Spielberg and David Lynch, Eubank is an Eagle Scout. When Eubank was young, he had an interesting experience with the verisimilitude of cinema. At the time that he first watched the 1974 film \"Chinatown,\" set in the year 1937, Eubank was unaware that it was a period piece, assuming it to have been made contemporaneously in 1937. When he found out it had been made almost four decades after the era it depicted, Eubank came to a realization about film's power.\n\nEubank worked at Panavision Woodland Hills as a camera repair technician and digital imaging technician for eight years; he describes his time at Panavision as serving as his film school. There he worked to promote and provide support for the Panavised CineAlta F900 camera. Using an early SDI capture card and brand-new eSATA drives that had just appeared on the market, Eubank stacked 14 hard drives on top of each other and drilled a hole into a Power Mac G4 in order to create an NLE system on a personal computer that could directly capture 1080p from the F900 camera. When the working result was seen at Panavision, co-workers agreed a shift was about to occur in  the industry. Eubank credits the company's kindness to him as being essential to his development as an artist saying \"I owe my entire career to those guys\".",

After graduating from college with an emphasis in theatre design from Nottingham Trent University, Glazer began his career directing theatre and making film and television trailers, including award-winning work for the BBC.\n\nGlazer has been nominated for two BAFTA Awards and twice for both the Golden Lion and the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival. He also received the nomination for the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction twice, consecutively for his work on Jamiroquai's \"Virtual Insanity\" and Radiohead's \"Karma Police\". His work is often characterized by depictions of flawed and desperate characters, explorations of themes such as alienation and loneliness, a bold visual style that utilizes an omniscient perspective, and dramatic use of music. His 2013 film Under the Skin received numerous accolades and awards and was included in BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century list.",

October, 9 1962, Brighton, England, United Kingdom) is an English film director and writer, known for Garfield (2004) (credited as Pete Hewitt), Thunderpants (2002), Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1991) and The Candy Show (1989).  Upon graduating from England's National Film and Television School in 1990, Hewitt flew to Hollywood with his BAFTA award-winning short film, The Candy Show, in hand. Once there, he called executives from major U.S. studios and asked if he could show them his film. Soon after, he landed an agent and made his feature film directorial debut with Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey. Although not as big a success as the original, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, the movie made a profit.  He turned to TV next, directing the first two hours of the mini-series Wild Palms. He directed Disney's Tom and Huck in 1995 which was based on Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Hewitt returned to Britain to film The Borrowers, loosely based on a children's novel by Mary Norton of the same name. He remained in England to helm Whatever Happened to Harold Smith? (1999), then tried his hand at TV work again with The Princess of Thieves (2001), filmed in Romania but featuring a mostly British cast, including a young Keira Knightley as Robin Hood's daughter, Gwyn.  Hewitt co-wrote the script for his next film, Thunderpants. It was filmed in the U.K.",
